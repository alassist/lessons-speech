# Lesson 1: Introduction

Aids for reading lessons:

If you need to pause this lesson, press the **Shift** key. To resume
speaking, press **Shift** again. If using JAWS or Narrator, press
**Control** to stop speech, then hold **Insert**, press **Down Arrow**
and release both keys to begin reading where you left off. If you need
further help, ask your instructor.

What is Windows:

Windows is an operating system created by Microsoft. An operating system
is instructions that your computer loads, in order to work with the
hardware and programs on your computer. Most computers have Windows
already on the computer, so all that a user must do is plug it in and
power it on to begin using it.

Windows allows a person to complete many computing tasks, like browsing
the Internet, writing documents, playing accessible games, and listening
to music. All this is achieved, by a person who is blind, through the
use of a screen reader, which reads screen contents and allows a person
who cannot see the screen to navigate the computer using keyboard
commands for both Windows and the screen reader.

For blind users, a screen reader must either be installed, if there are
no usable screen readers installed, or ran, if there are, so that the
computer can be accessed by the user. In Windows 8 and below, Narrator
is a built in screen reader, but isn't good enough to be used well, so
another must be installed. In Windows 10, Narrator is quickly becoming a
viable option, but others, like [NVDA](https://www.nvaccess.org) or
[JAWS for
Windows](https://www.freedomscientific.com/products/software/jaws/), for
now, may still be required for intermediate to advanced usage,
especially with navigating the web, and using Microsoft Office. Since
usage of a screen reader, and Windows usage, are intertwined, this
course will teach screen reader basics along with using Windows.

What are screen readers:

Screen readers are tools for the blind that read parts of the screen on
request, read items as focus is moved onto them, and give the blind user
tools to interact with the program one is in. Screen readers are not
simply tools that read email, web pages, documents, or folders aloud to
the user, but programs like any other, which allow the user to navigate
the computer, by speaking what the user has navigated to. The user may
optionally request other information, like the title of a window, a
document to be read from the current position to the bottom of the file,
or the time or battery status to be read. Mastering such a mode of using
a computer takes much time and practice. Therefore, practicing using a
computer, whether at home or at a training center, is advised. There are
a few screen readers currently in common use on Windows:

* NVDA: Non visual Desktop Access is a free, open source screen reader,
meaning that it doesn't cost any money, and that those who are interested can review its source code, or "programming." It works with
most modern versions of Windows, from 7 to 10, and can be used with many computer programs. Upgrades are free, but donations are gently
requested. It boasts support for many languages, can be extended with add-ons, and has lite braille support. It works with Microsoft Edge, Firefox, and google Chrome. It also has support for Microsoft Office, LibreOffice, and Google Drive for office work.
* JAWS: Job Access with Speech is a powerful screen reader commonly used
by blind employees or students. Its price tag is a hefty \$90 per year,
or \$1000 one time payment, with two upgrades after the current version
for the one-time purchase, or continual upgrades with the yearly
payment. It boasts scripts, which tell it how to work with programs that
are not very accessible, advanced braille support, and the ability to
connect to another user for technical support. It works with Microsoft
Edge, Firefox, and Google Chrome. It also supports Microsoft Office and
Google Drive for office work.
* Narrator: This screen reader has been included in Windows since Windows
2000, and was slowly improved since then. In Windows 10, however,
Narrator has gotten several updates, making it usable with Microsoft
Edge, and improving its support for Google Chrome. With its "scan mode"
a user can read an entire screen with just the arrow keys, and interact
with an item with the space bar. Narrator works with Microsoft Edge,
with some support for Google Chrome, which will improve with future
updates. It also supports some of Microsoft Office, and may support
Google Drive for office work.

Getting Started:

To help get you started navigating these lessons, here are some keys to
press for navigation.

-   Tab moves forward by control on a web page. A control can be a
    button to press, a link to another page, a checkbox to check or
    uncheck, a combo box to choose an item from, or a list of radio
    buttons, to choose only one option out of a few choices.
-   Space Bar activates a button, opens a link, opens a combo box,
    chooses a radio button, or checks a checkbox.

So, when you reach the end of this lesson, press **Tab** until you
hear"Lesson 2", and press the Space Bar. Then, press **Insert + Down
Arrow** which means holding down Insert, then pressing Down Arrow, and
releasing both keys, to begin reading the page. Ways of quickly getting
passed the navigational content will be covered later, or by your
instructor.

# Lesson 2: Navigating Windows

For people who have vision, navigating Windows is simple: find on the
screen what you want to activate, bring the mouse pointer to that
location, and click twice; one click for focusing on that item, the
second to activate that item. So, when you read a manual, article, or
lesson meant for sighted users, remember that "click" means to activate
an item, by pressing **Space Bar** or **Enter**. To activate an item,
though, you must find it first. So, if a lessons says "click on Lesson 2
Quiz" you must press **Tab** until you hear "lesson 2 Quiz," and then
activate it with **Space bar** or **Enter**.

For keyboard users, screen reader users included, navigating is slightly
more challenging, because screen readers do not read the entire screen,
and do not walk one through tasks as Digital Assistants, like Google
Assistant, Siri, and Cortana do. Instead, the screen reader simply reads
what it is focused or "highlighted," on, and allows the user to decide
what to do next. A user could press **Tab** to navigate to the next item
on the screen, or **Shift + Tab** to navigate backward, **F6** to move
to a different part of the window, or press a "keyboard shortcut" to
activate a function which is not currently in focus, or even in view on
the screen.

Navigating Windows will be difficult starting out, but as you practice,
it will make more sense to you, and you will be able to navigate the
interface easily and quickly. However, to get there, you will *have* to
practice often.

Screen readers also have their own navigation and information commands,
to support Windows navigation. Screen readers can have the time read to
the user, or report battery status, control the mouse pointer, or
provide a list of items on a web page. NVDA has Object Navigation, JAWS
has the JAWS cursor, and Narrator has Scan Mode. All three of these are
designed to navigate by a single item on the screen, in the case of NVDA
and Narrator, or navigate to things the keyboard navigation cannot
access, in the case of the JAWS cursor.

A Windows user who is blind may take advantage of these navigational
aids, although these are becoming less necessary as Windows
accessibility improves with software updates. A Narrator user, however,
may find that Scan Mode provides a good enough experience that it
becomes the main method of *basic* navigation for such a user.

There are keyboard commands for both Windows itself, and screen readers.
To know whether a keyboard command is a Windows or screen reader
command, study the keys used in the command. If the command has the Alt
Control or Windows keys in it, it is most likely a Windows command. If
it has the Insert key in it, however, it is most likely a screen reader
command. for example, **Control + S** is a Windows command, but
**Insert + Control + S** is a screen reader command. Most screen readers
give commands with the Insert key substituted by the name of the screen
reader. For example, **Insert + F** in JAWS is **JAWS Key + F**, in NVDA
it is **NVDA + F**, and in Narrator it is **Narrator + F**. In courses
from E. H. Gentry, it will just be called Insert or, rarely, Modifier.

Along with **Tab** and **Shift + Tab** are the Arrow keys. These
navigate text areas, called *Edit Boxes* in Windows. These boxes contain
any text, and are used in some programs to provide status messages or
information. The arrow keys can also be used to navigate content on the
Internet, navigating by line, up and down, or character, left and right,
like in a document.

Keyboard Shortcuts are also great ways to navigate Windows. For example,
holding **Insert**, pressing **Down Arrow**, then releasing both keys is
a keyboard command in almost all Windows screen readers. It begins
reading from the current line, to the end of the document or web page.
In many courses and websites, keyboard shortcuts (or key commands) are
written in a specific way. The keyboard shortcut **Insert + Down Arrow**
tells the user to hold down the Insert key, press Down Arrow and release
both keys. The notation **Control + S** tells the user to hold down the
Control key, press "S", and release both keys. If the user only has to
press one key, though, some courses simply put the key in quotes, like
"Press the 'h' key to move to the next heading."

Activity:

Now that you know basic navigation, try the following activities for
practicing what you've learned.

-   Press the **Up Arrow** to navigate to the previous line, then press
    **Insert + Down Arrow** to continue reading.
-   Press **Shift + Tab** to navigate to the previous control, then
    press the "h" key until you hear "activity heading level 3" and
    press **Insert + Down Arrow** to continue reading.
-   Press **Insert + F12**. What does this keyboard shortcut do?
-   The next section will be a quiz. Tab to "lesson 2 quiz" and activate
    the Link with **space bar** or **Enter**. Use the Arrow keys to
    navigate this page, and **Space Bar** to interact with items if
    needed, for example, to type in an Edit Box, or Check a checkbox or
    radio button. If you enter an Edit Box, press **Escape** when done
    typing, to exit the area and return to navigating with the arrow
    keys. Complete this quiz before moving on to the next lesson. To
    move to the next lesson after completing the quiz, tab to "Lesson
    3"and activate the link with **Space bar** or **Enter**.
# Lesson 3: The Windows Desktop

About the Desktop:

When you first start up your computer, your screen reader will
say"taskbar." We'll cover that later on, but for now, let's start with a
widely used area of Windows: the desktop. The *desktop* is a grid of
items which covers the screen, used for selecting a program, file, or
folder to open.

You can store files, folders, and shortcuts to commonly used programs
here. However, because it covers the entire screen when the computer
first starts, it is advised that you keep the desktop clean and
uncluttered, so that any sighted people who may share your computer, or
help you learn to use it, may find desktop items easily. The more items
on the desktop, the smaller they are, and the harder it becomes for a
sighted person to single out an icon to click.

For a complete file storage and retrieval program, see [File
Explorer](https://moodle.alassist.us/mod/url/view.php?id=2603). For a
clean way to find and open programs, see [the start
menu](https://moodle.alassist.us/mod/url/view.php?id=2599). For now, the
desktop should have few icons on it, including the Recycle Bin. The
Recycle Bin will always be there.

Focus:

*Focus* is an important term for screen reader users. It is what the
screen reader has just read. Technically, it is the item which is in
keyboard focus, being what will be activated when **Space bar** or
**Enter** is pressed. You can hear what is in focus with **Insert +
Tab**. For example, if it says "taskbar," it is focused on the Windows
Taskbar. If it says "Next button," then it is focused on a button
called"Next." Pressing **Tab** and **Shift + Tab** changes focus to the
next or previous item in the program that you're in.

Focusing on the desktop:

To move focus to the desktop, we'll use a Windows keyboard command.
**Windows + D** moves directly to the desktop, without making the window
you were in smaller. This means that the program you were in before, like Google Chrome or Microsoft Word, is still on the screen, but the
screen reader has *focused* on the desktop. Alternatively, you can use
**Windows + M** to make all windows small, and the desktop large, if you
have some usable vision, in order to see the desktop better.

In either case, you'll hear something like "Folder view list." This
tells you that you're in a folder view, like a list of files. The
desktop is a grid of items, visually in the form of clickable icons. A
*grid* is a file layout similar to a table. You must use all four arrow
keys to find all the icons on the desktop. The first icon you come to
may be the *Recycle Bin*, which holds all files you've deleted, waiting
to be deleted forever, or placed back into the folder where they were
deleted from.

When you arrow around the desktop icons, you'll hear a few pieces of
information: the name of the icon, like "Firefox," and the position of
the icon, like "2 of 10." This helps you know where in the grid of icons
that you are. Please note that, even though your screen reader calls the
desktop a list, and most lists only require the up and down arrow keys
to traverse, the desktop is actually a grid, requiring all four arrow
keys to traverse the grid.

When you find an icon you want to open, like the Recycle Bin, press
**Enter**. The program, file, or folder will open, and the desktop will
be placed in the background. To close an open program, press **Alt +
F4**.

Activity:

-   Set focus to the Windows Desktop
-   Navigate to the Recycle Bin
-   Open the Recycle Bin, then close it.
-   On the Desktop, navigate to an icon, press **Shift + F10**, then
    press **Up Arrow**. What option did you hear?
-   In the next section, complete the quiz before moving on to the next
    lesson.

# Lesson 4: The Start Menu

The *Start Menu* is the "launchpad" for all of your programs on the
computer. It allows you to run a program, or find items on your
computer. From the Start Menu, you can start a web browser, to navigate
the Internet, an email program, word processor, game, media player, or
administrative tool.

The Start Menu is slightly different depending on what version of
Windows you have.

Windows XP : The Start Menu opens, and is a menu which you navigate with
up and down Arrow keys. It contains sub menus which you enter or close
with the right or left arrow.

Windows Vista : Same as XP, with the addition of a "search box" at the
top.

Windows 7 : Same as Vista

Windows 8 : Start Menu is called "Start Screen," and is a grid of icons
navigable with all four arrow keys

Windows 10 : Similar to the Windows 7 Start menu, with a Search box at
the top, with icons in a list, a list of pinned icons, and the ability
to switch to Start Screen. Navigate this with the Up and down arrow
keys. In Desktop mode, there is the normal start menu. On tablet mode,
it becomes the Start Screen.

Since Windows 10 is now ubiquitous, and all new and upgraded PC's have
it, we'll focus on Windows 10's Start Menu.

Navigating the Windows 10 Start Menu:

When you press the **Windows** key to open the Windows Start Menu, you
are placed in a search box, where you type the name of the program or
folder that you want to open. A list of suggestions appear, and your
screen reader will read the suggestion in focus. To open that program or
folder, just press **Enter**. Now, the program or folder you have
selected will open. Your screen reader may say "Task Bar," meaning that
you are back near the Desktop. After a few seconds, it will then read
the title of the program, then the focused item within that program.

If you open the Start Menu again, you'll find that you're back in that
search box. Try pressing the **Down Arrow** to go to the list of all
programs on your computer. The list will start with a *header* which, in
this case, is the letter of the beginning of the app's name. This list
is in alphabetical order, so headers will range from A to Z.

What happens if you press the **Tab** key? Try it. Don't be afraid to
explore the programs, as long as it is for educational purposes. Just
don't spend too much time on exploring. You'll find a "pinned apps"
list, a button to show or hide labels, the search box, and the "all
apps" list again.

The Pinned Apps list is a list of apps that are "pinned" to that list.
This means that they will not change or be removed from that list. You
can pin apps to this list from the "all apps" section.

Some apps have "live tiles." This means that the icon contains
information from the app that is updated over time. The weather app on
the Start Menu, for example, may show the current weather, or the news
app may show a current headline. Your screen reader will read these live
tiles when focus is placed on the app's icon.

Activity:

-   Open the Start Menu, and arrow down through the list of "all
    apps."Which program names have you heard of before?
-   From the start Menu, find the Microsoft Edge app and press **Enter**
    on it. When the app opens, close the app with **Alt + F4**.
-   Open the Start Menu. In the search box, type "word". Open the Word
    app, then close it.
-   Open the Start Menu. In the search box, type in 5\*3. Did you get
    the answer?
-   In the Start Menu search box, type in "Documents." Use your arrow
    keys, if needed, to find the "documents: files and folders" option,
    and press **enter**.
-   In the next section, complete the quiz, then move on to Lesson Five.

# Lesson 5: Using the Taskbar

In this lesson, you'll learn how to use the Windows Taskbar to open
programs.

Introduction to the Taskbar:

The Taskbar in Windows is the place where all of your frequently used
programs can be placed, for easy access. The programs you'll find there
may include the web browser, email program, screen reader, and word
processor.

Using the Task Bar:

To access the Taskbar, press **Windows + T**. You'll be placed on the
first program in the taskbar. Use the **Left** and **Right** arrow keys
to navigate between all the programs on the taskbar, and press **Enter**
to open one. To make things easier, you may also use **Windows + 1**
through **Windows + 9** to open the program on that position of the
Taskbar. This makes opening programs very quick and easy.

Quickly switching Windows:

To quickly switch from one window to another, press **Alt + Tab**. To
move to a window that is not the two most recently used windows, hold
down Alt, and press Tab until you hear the window you want to move to, then release Alt.

Pin a program to the taskbar:

After using the Taskbar for a while, you may want to add programs to it.
To do this, follow the steps below:

-   Open the start Menu, by pressing the **Windows** key.
-   Type the name of the program, until it is in focus.
-   Press the **Context** key. This is also called the **Applications**
    key.
-   Arrow down to "Pin to taskbar".
-   Press **Enter**.

Now, the program you've selected has been added to the Taskbar. You can
explore the Taskbar to find its position, if you would like to use
**Windows + (number)** to open it. You can repeat the steps above to
remove an item from the Taskbar.

Activity:

Become familiar with the taskbar by performing the following actions. If
an item is not available on the taskbar, or is otherwise unable to be
done, you can skip it.

-   Navigate to the Taskbar.
-   From the taskbar, open Microsoft Edge by using its position number
-   Add Google chrome to the Taskbar.
-   Open Google Chrome using its position number.
-   Remove Google Chrome from the Taskbar.

# Lesson 6: Using the Notification area

Introduction to the Notification Area:

The *Notification Area*, also called the System Tray or status area, is
a part of the Windows desktop which shows system notifications and
statuses. It is to the right of the start button and Task Bar, and to
the left of the clock.

Accessing the Notification Area:

You can access the notification area using the Windows keyboard command
**Windows + B**. This will set focus to the notification area. Using
JAWS, you can alternatively use **Insert + F11** to access the
notification area in a vertical list.

Items in the notification area include:

-   A button to show all items
-   The network connectivity icon, used to connect to Wireless internet
    connections, if your computer has a Wi-Fi card.
-   Battery indicator, if your computer has an internal battery
-   Actions center, only on Windows 10, used to show app notifications.
-   Background programs, used to control functions of apps that run in
    the background, like OneDrive, Dropbox, and your screen reader if
    you have that function turned on.
-   Buttons to search with, or talk to, Cortana, Windows' digital
    assistant.

Using the notification area:

To use the notification area:

Using **Windows + B**:

-   Use **Left** and **Right** arrow keys to navigate items
-   Use **Enter** to "left click" or Activate items.
-   Use the **Applications** key to open a menu from the current item.
-   Use **Escape** or **Alt + Tab** to move focus away from the
    notification area.

Using JAWS' **Insert + F11** interface:

-   Navigate using the **up** or **down** arrow keys
-   Activate an item with **Enter**
-   Tab to the "right click" button to activate the context menu of an
    item.
-   use **Escape** to exit the list

# Lesson 7: Setting Settings

Introduction to the Settings app:

Just as you can set screen reader settings, there are also Windows
settings. These settings control things like how much power your
computer uses (this is good for laptops), sound volume and enhancements,
display settings, and software updates.

Opening the Settings app:

To open Settings, the app for changing settings, press **Windows + I**.
Settings opens quickly, and your screen reader will tell you that you're
in a search box. You can search for a setting to change here, if you
already know what you're looking for.

To get to a list of categories of settings, press **Tab**. If your
screen reader says that "Windows isn't activated," don't panic, just
press **Tab** again. Here, you'll be in a grid of categories, even if
your screen reader says that it is a list. Use the **Left** and
**Right** arrow keys to navigate through each item. Use the **Up** or
**Down** keys to move several items at a time. Find the "Ease of
Access"item, and press **Enter**.

If you use the Narrator screen reader, you may already be familiar with
this section. If not, you soon will be. Once you have chosen a category
of settings, you'll be placed into a vertical list. You can use your
**Up** and **Down** arrow keys to navigate this list. In the Ease of
Access settings, you'll find things like "Narrator," "Magnifier,""Sticky
keys," and many more. To activate one of these items, press **Enter**.
Now, you can press **Tab** to get to the settings of that chosen option.
For example, if you pressed Enter on Narrator, you'll find options to
turn it on, change the voice or speaking rate, and change other
settings.

To go back one screen, press **Windows + Backspace**. This is
the"Windows back command," which also works in many other Microsoft
apps, like Microsoft Edge.

To practice, find the "System" settings category, then the
"sound"section, then go back to the list of categories.

To exit Settings, as in every other Windows program, press **Alt + F4**.

# Lesson 8: About File Explorer

*File Explorer* is the program used to explore the files on your
computer, whether they be files you've made, downloaded, or files that
the system uses to do its job. You can use it to move or copy files
around, remove files, rename them, or view their statistics. You can
also open them in any program that supports the type of file.

Note: in older versions of Windows, "File Explorer" is
called"Windows Explorer."

Beginning exploration:

To open File Explorer, press **Windows + E**. You'll be placed in the
frequent folders list. This is more of a horizontal list, so use
**Right** or **Left** arrows to navigate. Moving down will put you
either farther down the list of folders, or put you into the "recent
files" list.

To open a folder or file, just press **Enter** on it. You can try this
with the "documents" folder in the list. Press **Right Arrow** until you
hear "documents", then press **Enter**. If this doesn't work, let your
instructor know. After pressing **Enter** on the "documents"folder,
you'll be in another list of files. This is a vertical list, and is
navigated with the up and down arrows. There are, however, columns in
this list, making it more like a table. These columns show other
information about the files in the list, like their sizes, dates of
modification, and file type. if you become stuck in one of these
columns, press **Left Arrow** a few times until you hear the *file
name*. The file name is what the file is called, like
"lesson6.html"."Lesson 6" is the name, while "HTML" which stands for
"Hyper Text Markup Language" is the file type. To move out of a folder,
and up into the list of folders, where you were before, press **Alt + Up
arrow**.

File types:

In your exploration of files, you may have discovered that files don't
end with just their name. They have a period, then a 2, 3, or more,
letter suffix. In your documents folder, for example, you may see a file
named document.docx, text.txt, python-program.py, spreadsheet.xlsx,
presentation.pptx, or even program.exe. If you've not seen all of them,
you will in your travels. Here is a list of the most common ones, and
what they mean.

* DOCX: Microsoft Word document
* TXT: Text document
* RTF: Rich Text file
* XLSX: Excel Spreadsheet
* Doc: Old Microsoft Word file, from Word 97 to 2003
* PPTX: Powerpoint Presentation file.
* HTML: web page file
* EXE: Executable program
* MSI: Program Installer file.
* MP3: MP3 audio file
* JPG: JPEG image file.
* WAV: Audio Wave file
* MP4: Video file.
* DMG: Disk Image; this usually contains a program made for Mac
computers.

Some operating systems, like Mac and Linux, do not need file type
suffixes, because it is in the file itself what it is, so some files you
may download will not always have a suffix. If your computer doesn't
show these suffixes, the setting to show them is disabled, and you will
have to arrow right until you hear what type of file you're on.

Tabbing around:

You may use the **Tab** key to move around the Explorer window. This
will not move you to files, just different parts of the window. Most of
them aren't very useful, except for the tree view.

The tree view allows one to navigate quickly to different folders, or,
more technically, parts of the file system. You can use your arrow keys
to move to a folder, and press **Enter** to go to it. Then, if
necessary, use the **Tab** key to go to the list of files and folders
within that folder.

Menu bars:

Menu bars are important parts of programs that let you control specific
aspects of it. Most programs use the *Classic menu bar*, Google Chrome
uses the *Chrome menu*, and most Microsoft programs use the *Ribbon*.
We'll focus on other menu bars in later courses, but for now, we'll work
with the Ribbon.

The Ribbon:

The *Ribbon* is a type of menu bar that has an upper and lower portion.
The *upper ribbon* has general groups, like "Home," "Share," and
"view."The *Lower Ribbon* has commands relevant to the upper ribbon. For
example, "email" is in the "Share" ribbon.

Your screen reader will call the upper ribbon controls "Tabs". For
example, if you are focused on the Home item, it will say "Home tab". To
enter the ribbon area, press **Alt**. You'll be focused on the
"File"item, which is a menu that opens when you press **Enter** on it.

To navigate ribbon tabs, use the **Left** and **Right** arrow keys. To
open a tab, use the **Enter** key, then you can tab through the items
there. Using the ribbon, or any menu bar, is a good way to find out what
a program can do.

Note: the ribbon in File Explorer is different than the ribbons in
Office programs.

You can also open the ribbon tabs directly, by listening for the
keyboard command to use. for example, you can press **Alt + H** to open
the Home tab. There are keyboard commands for most actions in the
ribbon. For example, press **Control + Z** for Undo, **Control + X** for
cut, **Control + C** for copy, and **Control + V** for Paste.

Activity:

-   Open File Explorer.
-   Find the "Documents" folder.
-   When focused on a file, open the Home tab on the ribbon.
-   Find the "copy" command.
-   Press **escape** a few times to exit the ribbon.
-   Copy a document from the "Documents" folder and paste it into the
    "downloads"folder using the keyboard commands given above.
-   In the downloads folder, press the **delete** key to delete the file
    just copied. If this doesn't work, make sure you select the file
    with **space bar** or the arrow keys.
-   Move back to the list of folders with **Alt + Up Arrow**.

# The Context menu:

All throughout Windows, and most other operating systems, there is a
menu that contains commonly used items. It is called quite a few things:
the "applications" menu, the "context" menu, or the "right click" menu.
Sighted people use the mouse and press the Right Mouse Button to access
this menu. Keyboard users have two ways of accessing this menu.

-   Press the Applications key on the keyboard, to the left of the right
    control key.
-   Press **Shift + F10**

Let's open the context menu here in the lesson. First, read this entire
list, then try the steps.

1.  Determine how you can open the context menu.
    -   If you have an applications key to the left of the right control
        key, use that. It's easier.
    -   If you need to, use **Shift + F10**. It's more universal.
2.  at the end of this list, press the **control** key, then activate
    the context menu. You'll find things like"Back" "Forward,"
    "reload,"and several other functions. In the future, you'll learn
    keyboard commands for most of these, but even then, some commands do
    not have keyboard shortcuts.
3.  To exit the menu, press **Escape**.

Now, let's put that into use. Open the Context Menu, then
choose"Refresh," and press **Enter**. The page will refresh. Find this
section (separator) again to continue. To do that, press S.

Activity:

-   Open File Explorer, find a file, and open the context menu on that
    file.

-   Open the context menu on a desktop icon, then a taskbar item, then a
    start menu item.

-   Copy and paste a file using the Context mEnu. You can revisit old
    lessons to merge what you have learned in those lessons with the use
    of the Context Menu.
    
Hint, simply replace use of the ribbon with the context menu.

# Lesson Ten: Editing Text

Writing text:

Up to now, we've simply moved around windows. Now, let's start creating
something. First, let's open a program where we can write things.

Press the **Windows** key, to open the Start Menu. Type "Wordpad" and
press **Enter**. You'll hear, among other things, "Word Pad, untitled,
edit, blank."

We've just opened a blank document. Let's write some text. You can write
anything, but if you want something to practice with, write the
paragraph below:

> Emacs is the extensible, customizable, self-documenting real-time
> display editor. This manual describes how to edit with Emacs and some
> of the ways to customize it; it corresponds to GNU Emacs version 26.3.

You should now have three lines of text. Try these keyboard commands
with them.

* Left and Right arrow: Move by letter (character).
* Up and Down arrow: Move by line.
* Control + Left and Right Arrow: Move by Word.
* Control + Up and Down Arrow: Move by paragraph.
* Home: Move to beginning of line.
* End: Move to end of line.
* Control + Home: Move to beginning of document, or "top of file".
* Control + End: Move to bottom of document, or "End of File".
* Page Up: Move one screen full of content up.
* Page down: Move one screen full of content down.

Try moving around the document. Notice what your screen reader says in
response to the movement. Be mindful of this as you edit text.

The cursor:

The cursor is how one navigates text fields. This includes text
editors: Emacs, Visual Studio Code, Notepad, and Word pad, word
processors: like Microsoft Word, Google Docs, and LibreOffice, and
online forms: like username fields, and comment text entry areas.


Moving the cursor

In Windows, you can move the cursor by using the arrow keys, home, end,
page up, page down, and a combination of these with the control key.
This is what you did with the sample passage above. The cursor moves to
the left of what the screen reader says.

imagine that the cursor is to the left of what the screen reader says.
It is like the erasing head of a Perkins Brailler. So, if you move the
cursor one character to the left, the cursor moves from its current
position, and reads the character before the one spoken by the screen
reader. In this way, actions are performed.

In our test paragraph, position the cursor so your screen reader is at
the end of the last line in the paragraph. Now, press **Backspace**.
You'll here the previous character be deleted. If you need help with
this section, you may always ask your instructor for help. Now that we
have the period deleted, backspace two more times. This gets rid of the
3, and another period. This leaves you with"Emacs 26" instead of "Emacs
26.3."

select text:

To select text, use **Shift** with any cursor movement commands. For
example, use **Control + Shift + Right Arrow** to select the next word,
or **Control + Shift + End** to select from the cursor to the end of the
file.

Manipulating text:

The following sections will teach you how to undo edits, move, copy, and
paste text.


Undo:

If you ever make a mistake when typing, use the *Undo* function of the
program you are using. The usual keyboard command is **Control + Z**.
Try this now.

Cut:

To cut something means to move it from one place to the clipboard. Then,
you can paste the text from the clipboard somewhere else. To cut, first
select the text to be cut, then press **Control + X**.

Copy:

To copy text, like copying a file, select the text, and press
**Control + C**.

Paste:

Pasting text lets you finish the cut or copy operation. To paste, press
**Control + V**.

The Clipboard:

The clipboard is a space in computer short-term memory that holds the
text you cut or copy. The text does not leave the clipboard once you've
copied text, so you can paste the text again, somewhere else. Your
screen reader, when copying, cutting, or pasting text, may say"cut to
clipboard," "copied to clipboard," or "pasted from clipboard."
