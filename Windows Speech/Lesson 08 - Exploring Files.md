# About File Explorer

*File Explorer* is the program used to explore the files on your computer, whether they be files you’ve made, downloaded, or files that the system uses to do its job. You can use it to move or copy files around, remove files, rename them, or view their statistics. You can also open them in any program that supports the type of file.

The File Explorer window is typically rectangular and divided into several sections. At the very top, there's a ribbon or toolbar with various options and commands. Below the ribbon, there's an address bar showing the current location within the file system.

On the left side of the window, there's a narrow vertical pane called the navigation pane. This pane contains a tree-like structure of folders and drives on the computer. Users can expand or collapse folders to navigate through the file system. Screen readers call this the "Tree view."

The largest section is on the right side of the window. This area displays the contents of the currently selected folder. Files and folders are typically shown as icons with names underneath, and are usually displayed as roes and columns.

In the main pane, users can choose different views, such as:

- Large icons
- List view (vertical list of names)
- Details view (showing file name, size, type, and date modified in columns)

At the bottom of the window, there's usually a status bar showing information like the number of items in the current folder or the size of selected files. If there are more items than can fit in the window, scroll bars appear on the right and bottom edges. 

The overall experience is designed to mimic looking through physical files in a filing cabinet, with folders and subfolders organizing the content hierarchically.

## Beginning exploration

To open File Explorer, press **Windows + E**. You’ll be placed in the home panel. This panel isn't very accessible right now, and will only say "pane". Press **Shift + Tab** to move to the *tree view*, which is where you can choose a folder to go to. Use your arrow keys to move throughout the folders, and press **Enter** on Documents. Then, press the **Tab** key to move back to the list of files.

After pressing **Enter** on the “documents”folder, you’ll be in another list of files. This is a vertical list, and is navigated with the up and down arrows. There are, however, columns in this list, making it more like a table. These columns show other information about the files in the list, like their sizes, dates of modification, and file type. if you become stuck in one of these columns, press **Left Arrow** a few times until you hear the *file name*. The file name is what the file is called, like “lesson6.html”.“Lesson 6” is the name, while “HTML” which stands for “Hyper Text Markup Language” is the file type. To move out of a folder, and up into the list of folders, where you were before, press **Alt + Up arrow**. If you have a folder inside of another folder, pressing **Alt + Up Arrow** will take you out of the subfolder, and back into the folder.

Let's say you have a folder in your documents folder. The path may look something like this, using the backslash to note a subfolder:

Student-account\Documents\College\English\101\First-paper.docs

Let's say you are in your Documents folder. You are now in:

student-account\documents

Now, if you press your arrow keys and find the College folder and press Enter, you are at:

Student-account\Documents\College

Now, if you press **Alt + Up Arrow**, you'll be back in:

Student-account\Documents

And if you press **Alt + Up Arrow** again, you'll be back in:

Student-account

In this way, you can navigate your file system through il Explorer.

## File types

In your exploration of files, you may have discovered that files don’t end with just their name. They have a period, then a 2, 3, or more, letter suffix. In your documents folder, for example, you may see a file named document.docx, text.txt, python-program.py, spreadsheet.xlsx, presentation.pptx, or even program.exe. If you’ve not seen all of them, you will in your travels. Here is a list of the most common ones, and what they mean.

- DOCX: Microsoft Word document
- TXT: Text document
- RTF: Rich Text file
- XLSX: Excel Spreadsheet
- Doc: Old Microsoft Word file, from Word 97 to 2003
- PPTX: Powerpoint Presentation file.
- HTML: web page file
- EXE: Executable program
- MSI: Program Installer file.
- MP3: MP3 audio file
- JPG: JPEG image file.
- WAV: Audio Wave file
- MP4: Video file.
- DMG: Disk Image; this usually contains a program made for Mac computers.

Some operating systems, like Mac and Linux, do not need file type suffixes, because it is in the file itself what it is, so some files you may download will not always have a suffix. If your computer doesn’t show these suffixes, the setting to show them is disabled, and you will have to arrow right until you hear what type of file you’re on.

## Tabbing around

You may use the **Tab** key to move around the Explorer window. This will not move you to files, just different parts of the window. Most of them aren’t immediately useful, except for the tree view.

The tree view allows one to navigate quickly to different folders, or, more technically, parts of the file system. You can use your arrow keys to move to a folder, and press **Enter** to go to it. Then, use the **Tab** key to go to the list of files and folders within that folder.

## Menu bars

Menu bars are important parts of programs that let you control specific aspects of it. Most programs use the *Classic menu bar*, Google Chrome uses the *Chrome menu*, and most Microsoft programs use the *Ribbon*. We’ll focus on other menu bars in later courses, but for now, we’ll work with the Ribbon.

### The Ribbon

The *Ribbon* is a type of menu bar that has an upper and lower portion. The *upper ribbon* has general groups, like “Home,” “Share,” and “view.”The *Lower Ribbon* has commands relevant to the upper ribbon. For example, “email” is in the “Share” ribbon.

Your screen reader will call the upper ribbon controls “Tabs”. For example, if you are focused on the Home item, it will say “Home tab”. To enter the ribbon area, press **Alt**. You’ll be focused on the "New" item, which is a menu that opens when you press **Enter** on it.

To navigate ribbon tabs, use the **Left** and **Right** arrow keys. To open a tab, use the **Enter** key, then you can tab through the items there. Using the ribbon, or any menu bar, is a good way to find out what a program can do.

Note that the ribbon in File Explorer is different than the ribbons in Office programs.

</aside>

There are keyboard commands for most actions in the ribbon. For example, press **Control + Z** for Undo, **Control + X** for cut, **Control + C** for copy, and **Control + V** for Paste.

## Activity

- Open File Explorer.
- Find the “Documents” folder.
- When focused on a file, open the Home tab on the ribbon.
- Find the “copy” command.
- Press **escape** a few times to exit the ribbon.
- Copy a document from the “Documents” folder, with **Control + C**, and paste it into the “downloads”folder using **Control + V**.
- In the downloads folder, press the **delete** key to delete the file just copied. If this doesn’t work, make sure you select the file with **space bar** or the arrow keys.
- Move back to the list of folders with **Alt + Up Arrow**.
