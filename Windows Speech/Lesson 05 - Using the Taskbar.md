Using the Taskbar
============================

In this lesson, you’ll learn how to use the Windows Taskbar to open
programs.

Introduction
----------------------------

The Taskbar in Windows is the place where all of your frequently used
programs can be placed, for easy access. The programs you’ll find there
may include the web browser, email program, screen reader, and word
processor.

Using the Task Bar
----------------------------------------

To access the Taskbar, press **Windows + T**. You’ll be placed on the
first program in the taskbar. Use the **Left** and **Right** arrow
keys to navigate between all the programs on the taskbar, and press
**Enter** to open one. To make things easier, you may also use
**Windows + 1** through **Windows + 9** to open the program on that
position of the Taskbar. This makes opening programs very quick and
easy.

Quickly switching Windows
-------------------------

To quickly switch from one window to another, press **Alt + Tab**. To
move to a window that is not the two most recently used windows, hold
down Alt, and press Tab until you hear the window you want to move to,
and release Alt.

Pin a program to the taskbar
------------------------------------------------------------

After using the Taskbar for a while, you may want to add programs to it.
To do this, follow the steps below:

-   Open the start Menu, by pressing the **Windows** key.
-   Type the name of the program, until it is in focus.
-   Press the **Context** key. This is also called the **Applications**
    key.
-   Arrow down to “Pin to taskbar”.
-   Press **Enter**.

Now, the program you’ve selected has been added to the Taskbar. You
can explore the Taskbar to find its position, if you would like to use
**Windows + (number)** to open it. You can repeat the steps above to
remove an item from the Taskbar.

Activity
--------------------

Become familiar with the taskbar by performing the following actions.
If an item is not available on the taskbar, or is otherwise unable to
be done, you can skip it.
