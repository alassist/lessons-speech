# Navigating Windows

For people who have vision, navigating Windows is simple: find on the
screen what you want to activate, bring the mouse pointer to that
location, and click twice; one click for focusing on that item, the
second to activate that item. So, when you read a manual, article, or
lesson meant for sighted users, remember that “click” means to
activate an item, by pressing **Space Bar** or **Enter**. To activate
an item, though, you must find it first, or bring it into focus. So, if a lessons says “click
on Lesson 2 Quiz” you must press **Tab** until you hear “lesson 2
Quiz,” and then activate it with **Space bar** or **Enter**.

For keyboard users, screen reader users included, navigating is
slightly more challenging, because screen readers do not read the
entire screen, and do not walk one through tasks as Digital
Assistants, like Google Assistant, Siri, and Cortana do. Instead, the
screen reader simply reads what it is focused, or “highlighted,” on,
and allows the user to decide what to do next. A user could press
**Tab** to navigate to the next item on the screen, or **Shift + Tab**
to navigate backward, **F6** to move to a different part of the
window, or press a “keyboard shortcut” to activate a function which is
not currently in focus, or even in view on the screen.

Navigating Windows will be difficult starting out, but as you
practice, it will make more sense to you, and you will be able to
navigate the interface easily and quickly. However, to get there, you
will *have* to practice often.

Screen readers also have their own navigation and information
commands, to support Windows navigation. Screen readers can have the
time read to the user, or report battery status, control the mouse
pointer, or provide a list of items on a web page. NVDA has Object
Navigation, JAWS has the JAWS cursor, and Narrator has Scan Mode. All
three of these are designed to navigate by a single item on the
screen, in the case of NVDA and Narrator, or navigate to things the
keyboard navigation cannot access, in the case of the JAWS cursor.

A Windows user who is blind may take advantage of these navigational
aids, although these are becoming less necessary as Windows
accessibility improves with software updates. A Narrator user,
however, may find that Scan Mode provides a good enough experience
that it becomes the main method of *basic* navigation for such a user.

There are keyboard commands for both Windows itself, and screen
readers. To know whether a keyboard command is a Windows or screen
reader command, study the keys used in the command. If the command has
the Alt, Control, or Windows keys in it, it is most likely a Windows
command. If it has the Insert key in it, however, it is most likely a
screen reader command. for example, **Control + S** is a Windows
command, but **Insert + Control + S** is a screen reader command. Most
screen readers give commands with the Insert key substituted by the
name of the screen reader. For example, **Insert + F** in JAWS is
**JAWS Key + F**, in NVDA it is **NVDA + F**, and in Narrator it is
**Narrator + F**. In courses from E. H. Gentry, it will just be called
Insert or, rarely, Modifier.

## Modifier Keys

Modifier keys are keys on the keyboard that change the function of
other keys. These are usually the **Control** key, at the very bottom
left of the keyboard, the **Windows** key, to the right of the Control
key, the **Alt** key, which is to the right of the Windows key, and the
**Shift** key, which is above the Control key.

After the Alt key is the Space bar along much of the width of the
keyboard. There are Right hand versions of the modifier keys to the
right of the space bar. They are Alt, Windows, Applications, and Control,
in that order. There is another Shift key above the right Control key.

In some cases, computer keyboards are different than the ideal. Some
of them do not have a Windows key on the right side of the space
bar. Some keyboards do not have an applications key. And some
keyboards have a key where the Windows key should be, which performs
other functions. The keyboards at the E. H. Gentry training facility,
or keyboards that you are loaned as part of distance learning, can be
different in those ways. Some have a key on the right side of the
space bar that is where the Windows key should be, but does nothing
for screen reader users. Some do not have a Windows key at all on the
right side of the Space bar. You must be adaptable to these kinds of
differences, especially if you use a laptop.

Using Modifier keys work a bit like using a foot pedal on a piano,
then playing notes, which are modified by the foot pedal. They're also
like some video games, where holding down a trigger or shoulder button
on a game controller modifies what the face buttons do. In either
case, you use them by holding down the modifier key, pressing another
key, then releasing both keys.

Modifier keys can do things on their own, though. If you press the
Control key by itself, your screen reader will stop talking. If you
press the Windows key by itself, the Start menu will open. If you
press the Alt key by itself, the menu bar or ribbon for the
application you're in, will open.

When you use a Modifier key on another key to modify it, the full key
press is called a *Keyboard command*. So, if you press Alt by itself,
you'll open a menu. If you press Tab by itself, you'll move to the
next item. But if you press **Alt + Tab**, you'll move to the next
Window that's open, if any. **Alt + Tab** is a keyboard command,
composed of Alt, and Tab.

In this course, we'll bold keyboard commands, and there will be a plus
sign (+) between the items that make up the keyboard command, like
**Alt + shift + Tab**. To perform that specific command, you would
hold Alt, and Shift, press Tab, then release all keys.

## Moving around Text

Along with **Tab** and **Shift + Tab** are the Arrow keys. These
navigate text areas, called *Edit Boxes* in Windows. These boxes
contain any text, and are used in some programs to provide status
messages or information. The arrow keys can also be used to navigate
content on the Internet, navigating by line, up and down, or
character, left and right, like in a document.

## Reading Continually

If you want to read a document or web page continually, without having
to press **Down arrow** so much, you can use **Insert + Down
Arrow**. This command is available in all screen readers, and tells
the screen reader to read from where you are on a page, like the
heading that begins your lesson, to the end of the page. When you're
ready to stop reading, you can press **Control** to stop it. Then,
you can navigate normally.

## Activity

Now that you know basic navigation, try the following activities for
practicing what you’ve learned.

- Press the **Up Arrow** to navigate to the previous line, then press **Insert + Down Arrow** to continue reading.
- Press **Shift + Tab** to navigate to the previous control, then press the “h” key until you hear “activity heading level 3” and press **Insert + Down Arrow** to continue reading.
- Press **Insert + F12**. What does this keyboard shortcut do?
- The next section will be a quiz. Hold down the Alt key, press Left
  Arrow, then release both keys. Then, Tab to “lesson 2 quiz” and
  activate the Link with **space bar** or **Enter**. Use the Arrow
  keys to navigate this page, and **Space Bar** to interact with items
  if needed, for example, to type in an Edit Box, or Check a checkbox
  or radio button. If you enter an Edit Box, press **Escape** when
  done typing, to exit the area and return to navigating with the
  arrow keys. Complete this quiz before moving on to the next
  lesson. To move to the next lesson after completing the quiz, hold
  down the Shift key, and press Tab until you hear "Windows Basics
  with speech link," and then let go of the Shift key. Press the Space
  bar or Enter to activate it, then tab to “Lesson 3”and activate the link with **Space bar** or **Enter**.
