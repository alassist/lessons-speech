# Lesson 02 - Basic tasks using a screen reader with Word

Use Word with your keyboard and a screen reader to quickly do all essential basic tasks, such as open, create, and read a document or add page numbers. We have tested it with Narrator, JAWS, and NVDA, but it might work with other screen readers as long as they follow common accessibility standards and techniques.

## Open Word

Press the Windows logo key, type word, and then press Enter. Word opens.

You can now start a new blank document to add your text and other content or create your document using a template with predesigned formatting. For instructions, refer to Create a new blank document or Use a screen reader to work with templates in Word.

## Sign in to your Microsoft account

Sign in to your Microsoft account to get the most out of the Word features and to take your documents with you wherever you go. You can also open Word without signing in.

Note: If you are using an account in an organization, the sign-in steps might be slightly different. For example, you might need to use a PIN or smart card to complete the sign-in. If you’re using a computer owned by E.H. Gentry’s Assistive Technology department, you won’t have to sign in, and should not sign into your personal account. You can skip the following steps if so. 

Tip: If you did not sign out of Word the last time you used it, the app opens without prompting you to sign in.

Do one of the following:

* Open Word. Press the Tab key until you hear "Sign in to get the most out of Microsoft 365," and then press Enter.
* If you're already editing a document and want to sign in, press Alt+F to open the File menu. Then press D, S. You hear: “Accounts.”
* Type your email or phone number, press Enter, and then press the Tab key. You hear: “Password.”
* Type your password, and press Enter.

## Open a recent document

All documents you have recently worked on can be found in one place so you can quickly pick up where you left off.

Do one of the following:

* Open Word, and then press Shift+Tab until you hear the name of a recent document.
* If you're already editing a document and want to open another one, press Alt+F to open the File menu, and then press Shift+Tab until you hear the name of a recent document.
	* Press the Up or Down arrow key until you hear the name of the document you want, and press Enter to open it.

## Create a new blank document

Do one of the following:

* Open Word. The focus is on the option to create a new, blank document and you hear: "Blank document."
* If you're already editing a document and want to start a new one, press Alt+F to open the File menu, and then press the Tab key until you hear: "Blank document."
	* To select and open the blank document, press Enter. You hear the default name of the document, followed by "Editing." The focus moves to the editing area in the document body.

You can now start adding text and other content to the document. For instructions on how to insert and format text in a document, refer to Use a screen reader to insert and change text in Word.

## Save a document

Word automatically saves your document to OneDrive or SharePoint when AutoSave is turned on. For instructions on how to turn on AutoSave, refer to Turn on AutoSave.

If AutoSave is not turned on or if you want to save the document with another name, to another location, or using another format, you can save your document manually to your computer, for example. For instructions, refer to Save a document locally. Alternatively, you can manually save your document to an online location. For instructions, refer to Save a document to OneDrive or SharePoint.

For instructions on how to save a document as a PDF, refer to Save a document as a PDF.

For instructions on how to use other saving options, refer to Use a screen reader to save a document in Word.

## Read a document

To use the text reading keyboard shortcuts, place the focus to the document body area.

To start reading from where your cursor is with Narrator, press the SR key+Ctrl+R or the SR key+Down arrow key. With JAWS, press the Insert  key+Down arrow. With NVDA, press the SR key+Down arrow key.

## Apply styles

Use the built-in styles to give your document a consistent look. Using styles can also improve the accessibility and usability of your document. Use the built-in heading styles if you want to insert a table of contents to the document. 

Place the cursor where you want to apply a style to.

To open the Styles menu, press Alt+H, L.

Use the arrow keys to browse the list of available styles.

When you hear the style you want, press Enter to apply it to your document.

## Navigate by headings

If you've used the heading styles in your document, you can use the Navigation Pane to quickly move from heading to heading.

To turn on the Navigation Pane, press Alt+W, K. You hear: "Navigation, Search document."

Press the Tab key until you hear the currently selected tab, for example, "Pages." Press the Left arrow key until you hear "Headings."

When you hear the search result you want, press Enter to move the focus to the document body where the searched word can be found.

### Search for an element

Search for a specific element, for example, a graphic, table, or comment from a specific person.
