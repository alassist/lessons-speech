# Lesson 01 - Use a screen reader to explore and navigate Word

## Introduction

Use Word with your keyboard and a screen reader to explore and navigate the different views and move between them. We've tested it with Narrator, JAWS, and NVDA, but it might work with other screen readers as long as they follow common accessibility standards and techniques. Note, the SR key is the Insert key.

## Navigate the main view

When you open a Word document for editing, you land on the main view. To cycle between the elements in the main view, press the F6 (forward) or Shift+F6 (backward). The main elements are, in order:

* The main content area, which shows the document content. You hear the name of the document, followed by "Editing," when the focus is on the document content.
* The status bar at the bottom of the screen where you can find document statistics such as page count, word count, text language, and zoom level. You hear the current page number when the focus is on the status bar, for example, "Page two of three." To navigate the status bar, use the Right and Left arrow keys.
* The row of ribbon tabs, which includes tabs such as File, Home, Insert, Review, View, and the Share and Comments buttons. The ribbon containing the options specific to the currently selected tab is located below the row of ribbon tabs. When the focus moves to the ribbon tabs, you hear "Ribbon tabs," followed by the currently selected tab. To navigate the row of ribbon tabs, press the Left or Right arrow key until you hear the name of the tab or control you want, and press Enter to select it.

To navigate from the row of ribbon tabs to the ribbon, press the Tab key or the Down arrow key once. You hear the name of the first option on the ribbon. To navigate between options on the ribbon, press the Tab key, Shift+Tab, or the Right or Left arrow key. You can also use keyboard shortcuts to select options directly. For the ribbon keyboard shortcuts, refer to Use the keyboard to work with the ribbon in Word.

## Navigate between views

In addition to the main view, Word has the following commonly used views and areas:

### The File menu

The File menu contains commands such as New, Open, and Save a Copy. You can also access your accounts and the app settings from the File menu. The File menu consists of a tab pane on the left and the contents of a selected tab on the right.

To open the File menu, press Alt+F. You hear: "File, home." The focus is on the Home tab in the tab pane.

To navigate between the tabs in the tab pane, press the Up or Down arrow key until you hear the tab you want to open, for example, "New." Press Enter to open the tab. The content pane of the selected tab opens to the right of the tab pane. To move the focus to the content pane, press the Tab key once.

To navigate within a tab content pane, press the Tab key, Shift+Tab, or the arrow keys.

To exit the File menu and return to the main view, press Esc.

For the File menu keyboard shortcuts, refer to Keyboard shortcuts for the File menu in Microsoft 365 for Windows.

### The Quick Access Toolbar

The Quick Access Toolbar and title bar at the top of the screen contain the document name, buttons for AutoSave, ribbon display options, and your account, and buttons for minimizing, restoring the size, and closing the active window.

To navigate to the Quick Access Toolbar and title bar, press Alt once. You hear: "Ribbon tabs." Then press Shift+Tab once. The focus is now on the Quick Access Toolbar.

To browse the available options, press Shift+Tab repeatedly. You can add and remove Quick Access Toolbar buttons and change their order on the toolbar. For instructions, refer to Use a keyboard to customize the Quick Access Toolbar.

### The Options window

The Options window contains Word settings, such as personalization, proofreading, and language preferences. The Options window consists of an options category pane on the left and the content pane of the selected category on the right.

To open the Options window, press Alt+F, T. You hear: "Word options."

To navigate the options categories, press the Down arrow key until you hear the name of the category you want, then press the Tab key to move the focus to the content pane.

To navigate the content pane, press the Tab key, Shift+Tab, or the Up and Down arrow keys.

To exit the Options window and return to the main view, press the Tab key until you hear "OK," and press Enter. To return to the main view without making changes, press Esc.

### Explore a document

#### Use the Narrator scan mode

To navigate the content of your document by elements, you can use the Narrator scan mode. To turn on the scan mode, press the SR key+Spacebar.

With the scan mode enabled, you can use the Up and Down arrow keys and keyboard shortcuts to navigate your document and cycle between paragraphs, other elements, areas, and landmarks. For detailed information on how to use the Narrator scan mode, refer to the external page, [Chapter 3: Using scan mode](https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/windows/chapter-3-using-scan-mode-7b2af804-5a2f-90fd-b0e0-672f7cbbf2da) in the Narrator user guide.  

To find the JAWS cursor that suits your needs, refer to the external site: [So Many Cursors, So Little Time, Understanding Cursors in JAWS](https://www.freedomscientific.com/webinars/so-many-cursors-so-little-time-understanding-cursors-in-jaws/), on the JAWS Training page . To learn how to use the NVDA Browse mode which is also optionally available for Word, refer to the external site: [6. Browse Mode](https://www.nvaccess.org/files/nvda/documentation/userGuide.html#BrowseMode), in the NVDA user guide .

#### Use the Navigation pane

You can use the Navigation pane to quickly navigate between parts of the document such as headings or graphics.

To turn on the Navigation pane, press Alt+W, K. You hear: "Navigation, search document, edit box."

Do one of the following:

To navigate the headings in the document, press the Tab key until you hear "Heading tab item," press the Tab key until you hear the heading you want, and then press Enter. The focus moves to the beginning of the heading row in the document body.

To navigate by certain elements in your document, such as graphics, press the Tab key until you hear "Search, split button," and then press Alt+Down arrow key to expand the menu. Press the Down arrow key until you hear the element you want, for example, "Graphic," and then press Enter to select. The focus moves to the next result button. Press Enter repeatedly to move through the results.

To close the Navigation pane, press Alt+W, K.

#### Use Read Mode

Read Mode is designed to make reading text easier and includes reading tools such as Read Aloud.

The Focus mode can help you minimize distractions and concentrate on writing, creating, and collaborating in Word. The Focus mode hides the ribbon and status bar, showing just the Word document itself.

To turn on the Focus mode, press Alt+W, O.

To turn off the Focus mode, press Esc.

#### Navigate between floating shapes

To quickly move the focus to the first floating shape such as a text box or a chart, press Ctrl+Alt+5.

To cycle between the floating shapes, press the Tab key or Shift+Tab.

To return to the normal navigation, press Esc.

#### Zoom in or out

Zoom in to get a close-up of your document or zoom out to get an overview of the page at a reduced size.

#### Use Search

To find an option or perform an action quickly, use the Search text field. To learn more about the Search feature, go to Find what you need with Microsoft Search.

Note: Depending on the version of Microsoft 365 you are using, the Search text field at the top of the app window might be called Tell Me instead. Both offer a largely similar experience, but some options and search results can vary.

Select the item or place in your document, presentation, or spreadsheet where you want to perform an action.

To go to the Search text field, press Alt+Q.

Type the search words for the action that you want to perform. For example, if you want to add a bulleted list, type bullets.

Press the Down arrow key to browse through the search results.

Once you've found the result that you want, press Enter to select it and to perform the action.
