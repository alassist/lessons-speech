# Lesson 03 - Use a screen reader to save a document in Word

## Save a document locally

To save the changes you have made to a document, if AutoSave is not enabled, press Ctrl+S.

You can also rename the document, save it in another file format, or save it to another location.

- To save the document with another name or in another location or file format, press Alt+F, A.
- To select the save location, press the Tab key once, then press the Down arrow key until you hear the location you want.
- Press the Tab key until you hear "Enter file name here," and type the name you want.
- Press the Tab key. You hear: "Save as type Word document star dot docx."
- If you want to change the file type, press Spacebar, and then press the Down arrow key until you hear the file type you want. To select, press Enter.
- Press the Tab key until you hear "Save button," and then press Enter.

## Add an online save location

OneDrive is available immediately when you start using Word, but you might need to add a SharePoint site manually before you can save there. If you’re using a workstation belonging to Gentry’s Assistive technology department, you don’t need to perform the following steps. In your own workplace, however, this may be necessary.

- To add a save location, press Alt+F, A, A. With Narrator, you hear: “Saving features, selected, add a place.” With JAWS, you hear: “Add a Place tab.”
- Press Y, 2 to select the SharePoint site option and then press Enter.
- When prompted, type the email address you use with your SharePoint site, and then press Enter.
- When prompted, type your password, and then press Enter.

The site is now available in the Save As dialog box in Word.

## Save a document to OneDrive or SharePoint

Before you can, for example, share a document via OneDrive or SharePoint, you need to save it to one of those locations.

- Open the document you want to share.
- To open the Save As menu, press Alt+F, A. You hear: “Save As.”
- Press the Tab key to move to the Save As pane.
- To move to a OneDrive or SharePoint site in the Save As list, press the Up or Down arrow key until you hear the name of the site you want, and then press Enter. The focus changes to the folder list for the site you selected.
- Browse to the folder location that you want and press Enter to open the Save As dialog box. The focus moves to the File Name field.
- In the File Name field, type or edit the name of your document.
- Press the Tab key until you hear "Save button," and then press Enter.

After your document has been saved to a shared location, you can invite others to work on it.

## Turn off AutoSave

If you don't want to save your document automatically to OneDrive or SharePoint, press Alt+1.

## Turn on AutoSave

To automatically save your document to OneDrive or SharePoint, turn on AutoSave.

- Press Alt+1. You hear: "How do I turn on AutoSave."
- Press the Up or Down arrow key until you hear the cloud location you want, and press Enter. If you hear a notification that a file with the same name already exists in the selected location, type a new name for the document, and press Enter.

## Save a document as a PDF

Save your document as a PDF, so you can share it using multiple channels. PDF files may not always be accessible, and it’s best to share files as Word documents.     

- To open the Save As menu, press Alt+F, A. You hear: “Save As.”
- Press the Tab key to move into the Save As pane.
- The dialog box suggests the same location where you have saved your Word documents previously, on your PC or in an online location. For instructions on how to change the location, refer to Save a document to OneDrive or SharePoint.
- Press the Tab key until you hear "Save as type, Word document, star dot docx," and then press Spacebar. A list of supported file types opens.
- In the list, press the Down arrow key until you hear "PDF," and then press Spacebar. You hear: "Save as type, PDF."
- Press the Tab key until you hear "Save button," and then press Enter.
