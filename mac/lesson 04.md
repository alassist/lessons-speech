# Using the Finder

In this lesson, you'll learn the key skills for effectively using the Finder in macOS to navigate and manage your files and folders. Topics covered include:

- Understanding and selecting default view modes
- Copying, moving, and deleting files
- Navigating folders and drives
- Setting folder hotkeys
- Making selections
- Working with external drives
- Using tags

## For Windows Users

If you are switching from Windows to Mac, there are a few things you should know about the Finder. First, try very hard to get used to pressing **command-O** to open things. Pressing enter will prompt you to rename them, not open them. If you do accidentally press enter, simply press escape to cancel. Just like in Windows, you can bring up a context menu for any file or folder with **control-option-shift-M**, not shift-f10 or the applications key, but the end result is the same. As you will see later, there is very little interacting, **VO-arrowing**, or other special commands. For the most part, Finder is as simple as opening a folder, using up and down arrows to browse it, and opening the file you want, similar to Windows.

## View Settings

Finder offers four possible view modes to display files and folders. The two most accessible for VoiceOver users are List and Column views. Here is a comparison:

| View   | Pros                               | Cons           |
| ------ | ---------------------------------- | -------------- |
| List   | Only shows current folder contents | No folder tree |
| Column | Folder tree always visible         | More cluttered |

For this course, we will focus on List View (**command-2**), since it limits you to the current location. But try both Column (**command-3**) and List to choose your preference.

## Copying and Moving Files

- To copy a file, navigate to it and press **command-C**.
- To paste the copy, go to the target folder and press **command-V**.
- To move instead of copy, use **command-option-V** when pasting.
- In List View, the file will paste into the current folder.
- In Column View, it will paste into the focused folder, which may be different from the open folder.

## Navigating Folders

### List View

- Open a folder with **command-O** or **command-down arrow**.
- Close a folder with **command-W**.
- Expand folder contents with **right arrow**.
- Collapse folder with **left arrow** (may need to press twice).
- Quickly jump to subfolders by typing first letters.

### Column View

- Expand folder contents with **right arrow**.
- Collapse folder with **left arrow** (may need to press twice).
- First letter navigation can get unpredictable due to auto-expanding previous folders.

## Folder Shortcuts

Use the following hotkeys to quickly jump to common folders:

- Home: **command-shift-H**
- Documents: **command-shift-O**
- Desktop: **command-shift-D**
- Downloads: **command-option-L**
- Applications: **command-shift-A**
- Utilities: **command-shift-U**
- AirDrop: **command-shift-R**

See Apple support for [full list of Finder keyboard shortcuts](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT201236).

## Setting Default Folder Views

To set default view for a folder or drive:

1. Navigate to the folder/drive in Finder.
2. Set the desired view like List or Column.
3. Press **command-J** to open view options.
4. Choose the current view as the default.
5. Click the "Use as Defaults" button.

This will now persist that view for that folder/drive. Repeat for any other locations.

## Making Selections

- Select contiguous files: hold **shift** while arrowing up/down.
- Add to selection: continue holding **shift** and arrow in opposite direction.
- Deselect all: release **shift** and arrow once.
- Select first/last item: **shift-option-up arrow** or **shift-option-down arrow**

For non-contiguous:

1. Interact with file list.
2. Find first file, press **vo-command-return**.  
3. Find next file, press **vo-command-return**.
4. Perform action like delete or copy on selections.

## External Drives

- View connected drives: **command-shift-C**
- Open drive: use arrows and **command-O** as usual
- Set default view for new drive using steps above.
- Eject drive: with drive focused, press **command-E**.

## Tags

Finder tags provide an easy way to categorize files for later searching. Some examples:

- Red tag for urgent documents
- Blue tag for financial records
- Purple tag for images
- Orange tag for receipts

To tag a file:

1. With file highlighted, press **command-I** to Get Info.
2. Select the Tags field.
3. Choose a tag color.
4. Close the Info window.

You can now visually filter files by tag color or search for tagged files.
