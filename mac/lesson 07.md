# Setting Settings in macOS

The transition from System Preferences to System Settings in Ventura takes some relearning. But the increased parity with iOS makes finding settings easier across devices. This lesson covers locating common settings in both System Preferences (Monterey) and System Settings (Ventura).

## Summary of Changes

System Settings organizes settings into categories like iOS. Use the table of contents to navigate then interact with the detail view. Settings can also be searched with **Command-Space** or in the table. Some panels are available in Control Center and menu bar.
