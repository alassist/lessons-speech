# Lesson 6

In this lesson, you'll learn about the Mac Mail app. The default Mail app on the Mac is easy enough to use once you set up your mail accounts. You up and down arrow through your messages, press delete to trash some, and so on.

## The Layout

Assuming your account(s) are properly configured and you are receiving mail, the setup of the Mail app will be something like this:

After the toolbar is the Favorites Bar Group. This holds any mailbox you've set as a favorite. If this is hidden, press Command-Option-Shift-H to show it. Next is the table of all your mailboxes. Note that your inbox, drafts, and other common mailboxes are unified; that is, messages from all your accounts appear together. To get to a single account, just find the mailbox and press right arrow to expand it, then down arrow to the desired account. If you don't see this table, press Command-Shift-M (the same command will hide the table if you want to get it out of your way).

After the table of mailboxes comes the Messages table; this is the actual table of messages. As is often the case on the Mac, you don't need to interact to read your mail. Simply pressing up or down arrow anywhere that is not the mailboxes table is enough to browse your messages.

By default, the Preview Pane is after the messages table. This displays the contents of the currently selected message, which has its pros and cons. You can press VO-J on a message to jump to the Preview Pane and read the content, which some find more efficient. However, whenever a message is shown in this pane, it is marked as read. If you rely on the unread status of a message to know if you still need to deal with it, then the Preview Pane is going to be a problem - just the act of arrowing past a message will cause it to become read, even if you don't actually stop to read it.
