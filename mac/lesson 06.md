In this lesson, you'll learn skills for effectively using the Mail app in macOS to manage email. Topics covered include:

- Account setup and message layout

## Account Setup

Once email accounts are added in System Preferences, messages will appear in the unified Mail inbox.

## Message Layout

The Mail interface contains:

- Toolbar
- Favorites bar 
- Mailboxes list
- Messages list
- Preview pane (optional)

You can navigate messages with **up/down arrow** without interacting. 

## Reading Messages

- **Up/down arrow** - Move through list
- **Enter** - Open in window 
- **VO-J** - Move to preview pane 
- **VO-A** - Read from cursor 

## Conversations

Threaded message replies are grouped into collapsed/expanded conversations.

- **Right arrow** - Expand conversation 
- **Left arrow** - Collapse conversation

If conversation controls stop working, disable then re-enable VoiceOver.

## Composing Emails

### Addressing 

- Start typing name 
- **Up/down arrow** to cycle suggestions
- **Enter** to confirm selection 

### Editing Addresses

1. Select attached name text
2. **VO-Space** for options
3. Choose new address

## Attachments

### Quick Look

View attachments without saving using **Command-Y**.

### Saving

Save from File menu. No shortcut.

### Manually Locating

1. **Enter** to open message
2. Interact with text 
3. **VO-arrow** to attachment
4. **VO-Shift-M** for options

## HTML Emails and Links

## Accessibility Inspector

The Accessibility Inspector is a tool built into macOS to inspect apps for accessibility support and identify issues. To use it:

1. Open Accessibility Inspector from the Accessibility section of System Preferences.

2. Choose Mail from the list of running apps. 

3. The inspector will analyze Mail and show the hierarchy of interface elements.

4. Select an element to view its accessibility attributes like label, role, position, etc. 

5. The inspector can suggest fixes for common issues like missing labels.

Using the Accessibility Inspector can help troubleshoot situations where Mail content is not being properly conveyed by VoiceOver. It takes some practice to use effectively, but is a valuable tool for evaluating and improving app accessibility.
