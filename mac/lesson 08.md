## Reading Text

VoiceOver provides many commands and gestures to read text:

| Command | Gesture               | Function                |
| ------- | --------------------- | ----------------------- |
| VO-A    | Two-finger flick up   | Read from top           |
| VO-A    | Two-finger flick down | Read from cursor to end |
| VO-L    | n/a                   | Read line               |
| VO-P    | n/a                   | Read paragraph          |
| VO-S    | n/a                   | Read sentence           |
| VO-W    | n/a                   | Read word               |
| VO-C    | n/a                   | Read character          |

Use **Control** to pause/resume speech. **VO-arrows** move by line, word, etc.

## Hearing Text Attributes

You can control when VoiceOver announces text attributes like bold, font changes, etc.

Use **VO-V** to open rotor to Verbosity settings. Choose:

- Play Tone  
- Speak Attribute
- Do Nothing

Can also set in VoiceOver Utility > Verbosity > Text.

## Selecting Text

Use standard Mac shortcuts like **Shift-arrow** to select text. But cursor tracking must be enabled in VoiceOver settings.

To select non-contiguous text:

1. Turn off cursor tracking with **VO-Shift-F3**.
2. Move to first section, press **VO-Command-Spacebar**.
3. Repeat for additional selections.

## Hearing What You Type

Set typing echo to hear characters, words, both, or nothing as you type.

| Setting    | Function                       |
| ---------- | ------------------------------ |
| Nothing    | No speech                      |
| Characters | Each character spoken          |
| Words      | Completed words spoken         |
| Both       | Characters and completed words |

Change in rotor (**VO-V**) or VoiceOver Utility > Verbosity > Text.

## Word Completion

Some apps like TextEdit display possible completions for partial words.

1. Type partial word.
2. Press **F5** or **Escape**.
3. Down arrow through suggestions.
4. Press **space bar** to insert selected word.

## Checking Spelling

Many apps let you check spelling as you type. Misspelled words are underlined.

1. Interact with text area (**VO-Shift-DownArrow**).
2. Find misspelled word: **Command-;**
3. Hear suggestions: **VO-Shift-M**
4. Choose correction.
5. Continue to next misspelling: **Command-;**

Can also use Spelling panel: **Command-Shift-;**
