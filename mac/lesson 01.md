## Terminology

The Mac refers to Apple’s line of personal computers. Mac laptops
range from the low-end MacBook Air to the high-end MacBook Pro. Mac
desktops include the Mac Mini, iMac, Mac Studio, and Mac Pro. For both
laptops and desktops, specific product families are differentiated by 
features, performance, and price. For information and buying advice on
the latest Mac models and specifications, check out [this MacRumors 
guide](https://www.macrumors.com/guide/best-mac-to-buy/).

MacOS is the operating system that runs on all Macs. It was previously
known as OS X, and mac OS X before that. Its major versions, released
annually, are named after California landmarks, like Catalina or
Mojave.

## The Apple keyboard

As modifier keys on a keyboard can vary greatly, there is no way for this course to cover every permutation of keyboard. For this reason, this course will be discussing locations of keys on the standard Apple keyboard, the keyboard that comes built-in on Mac laptops and is included externally with Mac desktops.

At the bottom row from left to right are the Globe, Control, Option, and Command keys, followed by the space bar. To the right of the space bar is another Command key, another Option key, and the arrow keys. On Macs without a Touch Bar, on the top row from left to right is the Escape key, followed by twelve function keys.
The Touch Bar is a small strip that holds dynamic touch controls for whatever app is in focus, in lieu of static function keys. Similar to using VoiceOver on iOS and iPadOS, move your finger along the bar to hear what is present, and double-tap to activate an item. If you need to simulate the press of a function key, either hold down the Globe key to display a virtual row of function keys on the Touch Bar and double-tap the one you want, or hold down the Globe key while pressing the function key’s corresponding number. For example, to simulate a press of the F7 key, you’d hold down the Globe key and press the number seven.

## VoiceOver and macOS basics

Like other screenreaders on desktop operating systems, VoiceOver is designed to be operated primarily from the keyboard, with a combination of VoiceOver commands and universal system and app keyboard shortcuts. VoiceOver commands are denoted by the VoiceOver modifier, which is either the control and option keys or the caps lock key. This is referred to as “VO” for short. Therefore, if you are instructed, for example, to press VO-Space, hold down the control and option keys (or the caps lock key) and press the space bar.

Move around the screen with *VO-left and right arrow*, and activate, or “Click” items with *VO-Space*. In some cases, the *tab* key will take you to certain elements, but this behavior is not totally consistent across the operating system.
For some elements, VoiceOver will announce that there are “Actions available.” Access the Actions menu with *VO-Command-Space*, and navigate the menu with the up and down arrow keys; press *VO-Space* to select a custom action. Custom actions are featured most prominently in apps ported from iOS and iPadOS.

In addition to custom actions, focusing on an element and pressing *VO-Shift-M* will reveal a context menu with additional options for that element. In literature intended for sighted users, accessing such context menus is sometimes referred to as “Control-clicking,” and is the macOS equivalent of a right-click.

If you’re trying to identify a particular VoiceOver command, either press *VO-H* twice to access the Commands Help menu, which is a list of all VoiceOver commands navigated with the arrow keys, or *VO-K* to access Keyboard Help, where keys can be pressed without having any effect on the system, similar to VoiceOver help on iOS or input help on NVDA for Windows.

### Interacting

By default, VoiceOver organizes interface elements hierarchically, meaning there can be elements within other elements. This is indicated by a slight pop sound when focusing on such an element.
While this behavior is not totally consistent across the operating system, element types that typically require interaction include toolbars, groups, scroll areas, collections, and sections, among others. To interact with an element, press *VO-Shift-Down-Arrow*, at which point pressing *VO-left and right arrow* will only work to navigate items within that element. To stop interacting, press VO-Shift-Up-Arrow.

While many different element types can be interacted with, it is not always necessary to do so. For example, if you just want to navigate or select an item in a table, you should be able to focus on the table and use the up and down arrow keys, you’d only need to interact if you wanted to select a checkbox or button within the table.

### The rotor

Similar to iOS and iPadOS, the VoiceOver rotor is used on macOS to navigate by different levels of granularity such as characters, words, and lines, as well as element types like links, headings, tables, and others. Move between lists on the rotor by pressing VO-Command-left or right arrow, and navigate the available items with VO-Command-up or down arrow. Pressing VO-U will present a rotor that solely contains element types like links, headings, and tables, which can be navigated using the arrow keys.

Additionally, the following commands can be used to navigate by specific element types. For any of these commands, hold down the Shift key while performing the command to find the previous occurrence of that element type.

* find next heading: VO-Command-H
* find next heading at same level: VO-Command-M  
* find next link: VO-Command-L
* find next form control: VO-Command-J
* find next table: VO-Command-T
* find next list: VO-Command-X
* find next frame: VO-Command-F

### The menu bar

The menu bar contains useful commands for apps, as well as global tasks like restarting or shutting down. From anywhere in macOS, access the menu bar by pressing VO-M. You are initially focused on the Apple Menu, located on the left. This menu is always shown, and contains commands that you can access from anywhere.

The menu immediately to the right is the name of the current app in focus. For example, if you are working in Mail, the menu to the right of the Apple menu will be named “Mail.” The rest of the menus depend on what app you have in focus, but are often file, edit, view, etc. Use the left and right arrow keys to navigate between menus, and the up and down arrow keys to cycle through the available options; press VO-Space to select an option.

These menus include commands for the app in focus, as well as the commands’ respective keyboard shortcuts. This is how the menu bar can become very useful as you gain proficiency on macOS, as keyboard shortcuts in apps can greatly reduce the steps needed to complete basic tasks.

In addition to common system and app commands, the menu bar is also used to display status information about your Mac, such as Wi-Fi connection and battery information, in an area known as status menus. Access status menus by pressing VO-M twice, navigate the menu headings with VO-left and right arrow, and reveal the menu options by pressing VO Space. Press the Escape key to exit the menu bar or status menus at any time.

Tip: As an alternative to using status menus, pressing VO-F7 (or VO-Globe-7 if you’re using a Mac with a Touch Bar) from anywhere in macOS will cause VoiceOver to speak the time and date, pressing it again will cause it to speak the battery level if you’re on a laptop, and pressing it a third time will cause it to speak the Wi-Fi status.

### macOS keyboard shortcuts

While VoiceOver includes commands to complete some core tasks, some of the most useful and ubiquitous commands are universal macOS keyboard shortcuts. They vary from app to app, but generally follow a basic format. Below is a list of the most common shortcuts, and you can find [a more comprehensive list of keyboard shortcuts available on macOS here](https://www.applevis.com/guides/general-keyboard-shortcut-commands-mac-os).

* new: Command-N  
* open: Command-O
* close current window: Command-W  
* quit current app: Command-Q
* print: Command-P
* Select all: Command-A
* copy: Command-C  
* paste: Command-V
* access settings for the app in focus: Command-Comma
* cycle between open apps: Command-tab
* Cycle between open windows in the app in focus: Command-Accent

## Setup

Once you get your Mac, if it wasn’t set up in store, you will be walked through a brief setup process. 
For a laptop, simply opening the lid should cause it to power on, at which point you may hear a chime. For a desktop, plug it in and turn on any accessories like a wireless keyboard and mouse, and press the power button, which is typically the only tactile button on the case. If you have a desktop that came with a wireless keyboard and mouse that are switched on, the computer should automatically recognize them and proceed with the boot process.

Once your Mac has booted for the first time, you will hear a voice that, in English says something like “To use English as the main language, press the return key.” As stated, press the return key, the rectangular key above the right Shift key on Apple keyboards, to use English or use the up and down arrow keys to select a different language. After a few seconds, you will be told how to turn on VoiceOver or start the quick start tutorial, which this course recommends if you’re new to the Mac.

From there, Setup Assistant guides you through connecting to a Wi-Fi network, signing in with your Apple ID, creating your user account, and configuring various other basic settings. If this is your first Apple product, it might be useful to create a free Apple ID on a device you’re more comfortable with prior to setting up your new Mac.  

Your Apple ID is the account used to access Apple services and sync your devices. If you’ve purchased content from the iTunes Store, for example, you already have an Apple ID.

At various points throughout the setup, you may want to jump to the top of the window to start viewing instructions for the current step. To do this, press **VO-Globe-Left-Arrow**, press **VO-Globe-Right-Arrow** to jump to the bottom. Once setup is complete, you’ll be placed on the Desktop.

## Updating your software

Periodically, Apple releases updates to macOS and bundled first-party apps. As updates may have been released since your Mac was packaged at the factory, it is a good idea to check once initial setup is complete. To do this, choose Apple > System Settings, select General in the table, and click Software Update. If updates are available, click update now; note that you may need to restart your Mac to complete installation of some updates.  

To update bundled apps, choose Apple > AppStore. Once you’ve passed any sign-in or welcome dialogs, choose Store > Updates (or press **Command-8**) to check for updates. Click the “Update all” button in the toolbar to download and install all updates.

## Configuring VoiceOver to start automatically at login 

By default, VoiceOver does not start automatically at the login prompt. To change this:

1. Choose Apple > System Settings, and select Lock Screen in the table.
2. Click accessibility options and toggle the “VoiceOver” switch on. 
3. Click done.

On some older Mac models, if FileVault disk encryption is turned on, which is the default, VoiceOver should start when the Mac boots and prompt for the username, and then prompt for the password if the username is entered correctly. However, if you’d rather not have to manually enter your username or be able to navigate other elements in the window, you must turn FileVault off. To do this, open System Settings, select Privacy & Security in the table, click FileVault, and click “FileVault turn off.” The contents of your disk will then be decrypted. 

## Changing function key settings to work best for VoiceOver

By default, the function keys on a Mac keyboard are mapped to certain “Special features,” like adjusting the display brightness, sound volume, or engaging Siri. However, in order to use these keys for other functions, like performing VoiceOver commands, you must either hold down the Globe key as part of the command, or override their special features in System Settings. To do this:

1. Choose Apple > System Settings, and select Keyboard in the table.  
2. Click Keyboard shortcuts and select “Function keys” in the resulting table.
3. Toggle the “Use F1, F2, etc keys as standard function keys” switch on, and click Done.

With this setting enabled, holding down the Globe key while pressing a function key will perform that key’s special feature. Note this may impact the behavior of some third-party apps that rely on the special function keys.

## Trackpad Commander  

If you use iOS or iPadOS, you’re probably well accustomed to using touch gestures to navigate with VoiceOver. With Trackpad Commander, many of these gestures can be performed on your laptop’s internal trackpad or an Apple Magic Trackpad connected via Bluetooth. 

To enable Trackpad Commander, hold down the VoiceOver modifier and rotate two fingers clockwise on the trackpad; counterclockwise to disable it. VoiceOver will play a sound and announce when Trackpad Commander has been turned on or off. Once it has been turned on, you can move your finger around the trackpad to explore by touch, or swipe left or right with one finger to move to the next or previous item; double-tap with one finger to activate an item. In addition, rotating two fingers on the trackpad with trackpad commander enabled will turn the rotor just as it does on iOS and iPadOS; swipe up or down with one finger to navigate the available items, and double-tap to activate an item.

The following is a list of some potentially useful trackpad gestures:

| Gesture                                       | Function                                                             |
| --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Two-finger double-tap near top of trackpad    | Go to menu bar                                                       |
| Two-finger double-tap near bottom of trackpad | Go to dock                                                           |
| Two-finger swipe right                        | Interact with element                                                |
| Two-finger swipe left                         | Stop interacting with element                                        |
| Two-finger swipe down                         | Read from position of VoiceOver cursor to end of document or webpage |

Additional settings and custom gestures can be configured in VoiceOver Utility > Commanders > Trackpad.
