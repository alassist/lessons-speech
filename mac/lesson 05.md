# Using Safari   

In this lesson, you'll learn key skills for browsing the web effectively with VoiceOver in Safari on macOS. Topics covered include:

- Understanding how VoiceOver interprets webpages
- Navigating by headings, links, and other elements
- Interacting with forms 
- Working with tables
- Using web spots
- Helpful commands and shortcuts

## How VoiceOver Sees Webpages

On Windows, webpages are parsed into virtual documents for navigation with arrow keys. In macOS 10.9 and earlier, VoiceOver leaves pages as-is and you navigate by element "chunks" using **VO-left/right arrow**. 

Starting in 10.10, Safari added Windows-style arrow key navigation when Quick Nav is off. So you can now navigate by character, word, line, etc.

## Navigating By Web Elements

There are several methods to jump to headings, links, forms, etc on a page.

| Method | Pros | Cons |
|-|-|-|
| Quick Nav | Familiar to Windows users | Can interfere with form entry |
| VO commands | More precise | More to remember |
| Rotor | Touch access on trackpads | Less flexible than Quick Nav |

## Links 

To open links:

- **Enter** - Open
- **Option-enter** - Download 
- **Command-enter** - Open in new tab

## Forms

Enable tabbing between form fields in Safari settings.

### Focus Order

Tab or **VO-right/left arrow** to move.

### Entering Text 

Just start typing once focused. Quick Nav must be off. 

### Dropdowns

**VO-space** or **down arrow** to open, arrow keys to navigate, **enter** to select.

### Checkboxes and Radio Buttons

**Space**, **VO-space**, or **up-down arrow** (Quick Nav only).

## Tables

- **VO-arrow keys** to move cell by cell 
- **VO-home/end** to jump to top/bottom
- **VO-T** to toggle table interaction on/off

## Web Spots

Save and jump to specific spots on a page.

- Next spot: **VO-command-right bracket** 
- Previous spot: **VO-command-left bracket**
- Set new spot: **VO-command-shift-right bracket** 
- Remove spot: **VO-command-shift-left bracket**

## Useful Commands

- Open URL: **command-L**
- Back page: **command-left bracket**
- Forward page: **command-right bracket**  
- Refresh page: **command-R**
- View downloads: **command-option-L**
- Toggle Reader mode: **command-shift-R**

## VoiceOver Trackpad Gestures

If using a trackpad, rotate two fingers to cycle through web elements. Up/down swipes to move between elements. Other gestures like two-finger double tap to activate links also work. See Apple's [trackpad gesture guide](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/voiceover-guide/vpav1109/10/web/1#10) for more.

## Troubleshooting Web Page Accessibility 

Many pages have imperfect markup that can create navigation or labeling issues. Try Quick Nav, headings navigation, Semantic Inspector, and other tools to work around problems. WebAIM's [Introduction to Screen Readers](https://webaim.org/techniques/screenreader/) has great tips.
