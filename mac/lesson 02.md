# Basic tasks with the Mac

In this lesson, we'll cover basic tasks and usage of the Mac.

## The Desktop

The Desktop is the first point you’re placed after logging in. It is a place where any file can be placed, and by default is where external storage devices are mounted for quick access. From anywhere in macOS, jump to the Desktop by pressing **VO-Shift-D**. Navigate items using the arrow keys, and press **VO-Space** to open an item. 

In addition to files, folders and storage devices, you can place widgets, extensions of apps that allow you to view quick snippets of information or perform basic tasks without needing to have the app open, on the Desktop. To do this, press **VO-O** to open Notification Center, and click the “Edit widgets” button. Locate a widget under the “Widget suggestions” heading, and choose “drag to desktop” from the Actions menu. Interact with a widget on the Desktop to view its contents, or access additional options for that widget in its context menu.

## The dock

Similar to iPadOS, the dock in macOS contains apps that you can access quickly from anywhere in the operating system. Access the dock by pressing **VO-D** and navigate apps using the left and right arrow keys. Open apps using **VO-Space**, or view additional options for an app in its context menu. Exit the dock at any time by pressing the Escape key.  

To add an app to the dock, press **Command-Shift-A** to access the Applications folder, use the arrow keys to locate the app, and press **Command-O** to open it. Then, locate it in the dock, (it should be to the right of your existing dock items) access the context menu with **VO-Shift-M**, and choose “Keep in dock” from the “options” submenu. To change the position of an app on the dock, focus on it and press **Option-Left-Arrow** to move it to the left, or **Option-Right-Arrow** to move it to the right.

## Control Center

Similar to iOS and iPadOS, you can use Control Center on macOS to change a wide variety of basic settings. Access Control Center either from the status menus or by pressing **VO-Shift-O** from anywhere in macOS. 

Navigate the settings with **VO-left and right arrow**, and press **VO-Space** to toggle a setting on or off. Additional options for a setting can be accessed by focusing on it and choosing “Show details” from the Actions menu. You can change what’s included in this view in System Settings > Control Center.

## Notifications

Similar to other operating systems, macOS uses notifications to signify when something requires your attention. Notifications include texts, emails, calls from your iPhone, alerts from third-party apps and websites, and more.

Like iOS and iPadOS, there are two types of notifications, banners and alerts; banners only remain on the screen for a few seconds whereas alerts stay on the screen until you act on them. To act on an alert, press **VO-N** to open the Notifications menu, select the alert, and choose an action from the Actions menu.  

To access Notification Center, where all notifications are displayed, press **VO-O**. When focused on a notification in this view, press **VO-Space** to open it in the app or website that sent it, or use the Actions menu to view options specific to the notification.

If you’d rather certain apps not send notifications, you can turn this capability off on an app-by-app basis in System Settings > Notifications. Additionally, individual apps’ settings may include more granular controls for determining what events or types of content, at what times, that app will notify you about.

Even for notifications you find useful, you may find, as you use macOS more, that they can be quite distracting or overwhelming when received at the wrong time or in excess. To help you manage these common distractions and hopefully reduce your stress level, you can use “Focuses,” profiles that allow you to configure what apps and people, at what times, will cause a notification to appear on your Mac, as well as other devices signed into your Apple ID. If you do not want to receive notifications for anything, you can turn on do not disturb, which blocks most notifications, or you can create your own focuses for increased customizability in System Settings > Focus.

In addition to customizing notification settings, focuses allow you to choose the type of content you see within supported apps when enabled. For example, when you’re working, you could configure a “Work” focus to only allow people and apps related to your work to send you notifications, and only display your work calendar in the Calendar app. Conversely, when you’re not working, you could configure a “Personal” focus to allow notifications from all apps and people except those related to your work, and hide your work calendar in the Calendar app.

## Finder 

Finder is macOS’s file manager, and is always open. Think of it as the equivalent of File Explorer on Windows. It is where you create, organize and delete files and folders, view external storage devices, and manage and sync iOS devices. For more information, check out [this guide to using Finder on macOS](https://www.apple.com/finder/).

## Spotlight

Spotlight lets you search for files and other data on your Mac, connected devices, and the Internet. It can be accessed from the status menus, or by pressing **Command-Space** from anywhere in macOS.  

Type your search in the field and use the up and down arrow keys to navigate the results. If what you’re looking for is not in the list, select “Search in Finder” to open a Finder window with all the results on your Mac, or “Search the web” to perform a web search using your default browser and search engine. Settings like the keyboard shortcut, the types of results to include, and locations to exclude can be changed in System Settings > Siri & Spotlight.

## Siri

Siri is the intelligent personal assistant built in to macOS and other apple platforms. It can be used to look up information such as weather forecasts, sports scores, stock prices, and calendar events and reminders, call or text people if you have an iPhone and the relevant features set up, turn some settings on and off, open apps, and more.

By default, it can be engaged by holding down the F5 key, or Globe-F5 if you’ve configured the function keys to override their special features. Issue your command when you hear a ding sound, and release the key(s) when you’re done talking. Siri should then respond with an answer, a followup question, or if it searches the web, an interface with the search results.

When you first set up your Mac, you were also probably asked to train Siri to recognize your voice, which allows you to activate it without pressing any keys by preceding your command with “Siri.” For example, if I wanted to call a contact named John, I would say “Siri, call john,” and it should respond by calling that contact. Likewise if I wanted to text them, I would say “Siri, text John,” followed by the content of my message. The following is a list of some other things you can say to Siri, though it is in no means comprehensive.

* What’s the weather today?  
* What’s the weather like this weekend?
* What time is it in London?
* What’s Apple’s stock price? 
* How’s the Dow doing today?
* What’s the score of the Red Sox game?
* How tall is LeBron James?
* How many Super Bowls has Tom Brady won? 
* How many ounces are in a pound?
* What’s 5 Dollars in Euros?  
* How do you say “Hello” in Spanish?
* Set an alarm for 9 AM tomorrow.  
* Turn my 9 AM alarm off.
* Remind me to get milk when I leave work. 
* Read me my texts.
* Play some music (Apple Music subscription or local song download required).  
* Turn on do not disturb.
* Open Accessibility Settings.  
* Find the nearest 7-11.
* Call BestBuy (it will automatically present listings around your current location)
* Flip a coin.  

Siri settings, like the voice and keyboard shortcut, can be changed in System Settings > Siri & Voice Input.

## Basic word processing

While the purpose of this section is not to cover one app, there are some concepts central to VoiceOver and macOS that can help you get started with basic word processing.

Your Mac comes with two main word processors, TextEdit, a basic document creation tool, and Pages, Apple’s answer to Microsoft Word. To open these apps, navigate to the Finder, and then press **Command + Shift + A**, to open the Applications folder, and then arrow down to the app, or start typing its name. Once you've found the app, press **Command + O** to open it.

To navigate text, use the left and right arrow keys to move by character, **Option-left** and **Option-right arrow keys** to move by word, and up and down arrow keys to move by line; hold down the Shift key with any of those commands to select text the cursor passes. Unlike Windows screenreaders, VoiceOver by default speaks text the cursor passes rather than text to the right of the cursor. You can change this if you wish by going to VoiceOver Utility > Verbosity > Text, and choosing “Speak text to the right of the cursor” from the “when moving the cursor” popup menu. The following additional commands should work in any app used for creating and editing documents:

* bold selected text: **Command-B**  
* italicize selected text: **Command-I**
* read text formatting: **VO-T**
* jump to top of document: **Command-Up-Arrow** 
* jump to bottom of document: **Command-Down-Arrow**
* read from position of VoiceOver cursor to end of document: **VO-A**
* check spelling: **Command-semicolon**
* reveal full spell and grammar check window: **Command colon**

### Dictation

Similar to iOS and iPadOS, you can use dictation on macOS to speak rather than type text.  

To dictate text, when in a text field, press the F5 key (or Globe-F5 if you’ve configured the function keys to override their special features) and start speaking when you hear a ding sound. Press the key(s) once more when you’re done talking, and the text will be inserted and spoken by VoiceOver. In addition to words, you can also dictate punctuation and line breaks, and macOS will attempt to infer punctuation based on your speech patterns and tone of voice.  

Dictation settings, like the microphone and keyboard shortcut, can be changed in System Settings > Keyboard.

### Emoji

Emojis are special characters that can give a sense of personality to what you’re typing. These can be used to convey emotions, expressions of individual identity, objects, and more.

From most text fields, emojis can be inserted by pressing the Globe key to reveal the emoji & symbols window, interacting with the table, navigating to and interacting with the grid immediately below the desired emoji’s category, and navigating to and pressing **VO-Space** on the emoji. Alternatively, you can focus on the search field at the top of the table to search for an emoji, interact with the grid immediately below the field, and press **VO-Space** on the desired emoji. In addition, some emojis include customizations which can be accessed by focusing on them and pressing **VO-Shift-M**.

## Web Browsing  

When navigating websites, VoiceOver contains them in groups announced as “Web content.” When interacting with these groups, you can use the arrow keys to navigate the webpage as if it were a document, **VO-left** and **VO-right arrow** to move by paragraphs and web elements, and the rotor and related navigation commands for more granular navigation. Alternatively, press **VO-A** to read from the position of the VoiceOver cursor to the end of the webpage.  

In addition, pressing **VO-Q** will turn single-key Quick Nav on, where similar to Windows screenreaders, the press of a single key will take you to the element type associated with that key. For example, pressing H and Shift-H will take you to the next and previous heading, respectively, pressing a number from one to six or Shift with a number will take you to the next and previous heading at that level, respectively, pressing J and Shift-J will take you to the next and previous form control, respectively, etc. These commands can be changed in VoiceOver Utility > Commanders > Quick Nav.

## Braille  

In addition to spoken feedback, VoiceOver on macOS supports a wide variety of refreshable braille displays. Braille displays can be connected to your Mac via USB, or paired and configured via Bluetooth by putting your display into its pairing mode (it is known by a variety of names) and going either to System Settings > Bluetooth, or VoiceOver Utility > Braille. Check your display’s documentation for specific pairing instructions.

If you have any questions or problems with braille on macOS, your best bet is to post to the AppleVis forum or a similar group, or to contact Apple or the display’s manufacturer for assistance. This course does not go in depth into the usage of Braille displays, and every display has different commands to be used with VoiceOver.
