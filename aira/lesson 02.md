# Getting Started with AIRA

Getting started with AIRA requires having a smartphone, either an iPhone or an Android phone. You can go to <http://aira.io/app> to download the app or search for “aira” on your phone’s App Store, or Google Play store. You’ll need to create an account within the app to get started using the service.

# Activity

-   Open the AIRA app.
-   Accept permission to send notifications. When you make your first call, accept permission to use the camera, microphone, and any others.
-   Enter your phone number, and tap “get started”.
-   You’ll receive a text message with a temporary code to enter into the app. Do so, and your phone number will be verified.
-   Activate the seven-day trial to begin using AIRA.

**Note** that if you are around the AIDB campuses or regional centers, AIRA use for you will be free.

If you’d like to use AIRA anywhere, and not just in free locations like AIDB campuses and regional centers, you can sign up as an AIRA explorer. This involves paying for a monthly plan, starting at $30 per month. To do this, open the AIRA app, tap the “more” tab, and choose “Upgrade to an Explorer,” then select the plan that’s right for you. Provide your personal information as well as billing information, review the purchase, and check out.
