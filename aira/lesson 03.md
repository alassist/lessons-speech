# Using the AIRA app

This lesson will focus on using the AIRA app. You may use AIRA on an
Android phone or an iPhone, and with or without the AIRA Horizon phone
or glasses.


# the Tab list

The tab list is a constant part of the application, and contains the
following options:


## For iOS

-   Home
-   My Glass
-   Live
-   Usage
-   More

If you are in a tab, VoiceOver will announce it as “selected.” A common phrase you will
hear is: “Selected, Home, Tab. One of five.” This means that you are
currently in the “Home” part of the app, and that there are five
parts, or tabs. To go to a different part of the app, simply find a
different tab, and double tap on it.


## for Android

Android users move through the app using the navigation button which,
when activated, opens up a menu with the following options:

-   Your profile information
-   Home
-   My Glass
-   Usage
-   Referral
-   Minute Sharing
-   Share Photo
-   Wi-Fi
-   Aira Access
-   Support
-   About

Although Android uses a menu format, we’ll still refer to this list of
options as the tab list in this course.


# the Home tab

The “Home” tab is where you call an AIRA agent from. The options, in
order, are:


## For iOS

-   Selected profile, for employee accounts
-   Glass
-   Phone
-   Search and Apply a free offer
-   Call AIRA from phone
-   Start call with a message
-   Home tab


## For Android

-   Open Navigation
-   Home
-   Glass
-   Phone
-   Search & Apply a Free Offer
-   Call AIRA
-   Start call with a message


## the Call Screen

On both platforms, if you call an AIRA agent, you’ll be placed in the
“connecting to agent” screen. Here are the items you have in this
screen:

-   Connecting to agent (text)
-   Cancel button

The only action you can take in this screen is to cancel your call,
which will take you back to the home tab in the app.


## Call screen

In the call screen, you have the following items:


## iOS

-   Name of the agent
-   Duration of the call
-   Sound output
-   Message (button)
-   Privacy Mode (on/off)
-   Speaker (button)
-   End (button)


## Android

-   Name of the agent
-   Duration of the call
-   Connected audio status
-   Privacy Mode (on/off)
-   Speaker (button)
-   End (button)

After the call ends, you’ll be able to give feedback on the call. If
you don’t want to, just double-tap the cancel button or “skip feedback.”


# The glass tab

The glass tab allows you to manage your AIRA glasses. This will be
covered in more detail later.


# the Live tab

This feature, currently for iOS only, allows subscribed AIRA explorers
to start their own live audio streams. This allows them to show others
what they can do with AIRA. To begin a live stream, simply connect
with an AIRA agent, and, when ready, tell the agent that you’d like to
go live. The agent will ask if you’d like to make it public or
private, and to name the live session. To view the live stream, the
viewer must have the AIRA app installed.


# The Usage tab

The “usage” tab allows you to view usage statistics about your
account, rate AIRA agents, see how many minutes you have left in your
plan, purchase more minutes, if needed, and review call history.


# The More tab

In the “more” tab, you can manage your profile, view photos taken by
agents while on calls, set up ride sharing integration, refer friends,
purchase minutes, share minutes, change AIRA access settings, turn on
messaging support, enable Siri integration, read the help center,
explorer guide, get help over the phone, or log out of your account.


# Using AIRA with Teamviewer

AIRA can be used to accomplish many tasks done on the computer. These
may range from using an inaccessible website, using digital
signatures, and reading inaccessible PDF files. To do so, AIRA uses a
program called Teamviewer. Please visit [Teamviewer's site](https://www.teamviewer.us/) to learn
more about TeamViewer and to download the software.
