To open Google Docs, in a web browser, open a new window, or tab if
that\'s your preference. On Windows, press **Control + N**. On Mac,
press **Command + N**. On Chrome devices, press **Control + N**.

Now, you have a new Window. Move to the address bar, on Windows with
**Control + L**, on Mac with **Command + L**, and Chrome devices with
**Control + L**. Here, type the address docs.google.com and press
**Enter**, on Windows or Chrome devices, or **Return** on Mac.

Now, your screen reader will move to the "Recent documents" list. This
list contains documents that you\'ve worked on recently.

When you open Google Docs, you land on the Recent Documents list.
However, that isn't the only item on the page. Take some time to explore
what's on the page, using the **Tab** key.

    -   This creates a new text document. The dialog for choosing a
        template opens.

    -   This opens a menu containing other Google apps, like Sheets,
        slides, forms, and also has a "settings" item.

[]{#anchor-14}Configuring accessibility

In Docs, screen reader mode must be enabled. To do this, press **Control
+ Alt + Z**. You'll hear "screen reader mode enabled." Now, you can use
Docs fairly well, but for better access, even if you don't have a
Braille Display, you should turn on Braille Support. To do that:

-   Press **Alt + T** to open the Tools menu. If that doesn't work,
    press **Alt + Shift + T**.
-   Press **Up Arrow** to reach "accessibility settings."
-   Tab until you hear "enable braille support", and press the SpaceBar
    to check the check box. If the box is already checked, skip to the
    next step.
-   Tab to the "ok" button, and press **Enter**.

To close a document, simply close its Window, or navigate to a different
page. You do *not* have to save your work, it is saved automatically.
