# Lesson 9: Getting Started with Google Docs with a screen reader

In this part of the course, lesson nine onward, you'll learn much more
about Google Docs. You'll start from the Google Docs interface, learn
to edit documents, format and check spelling, and collaborate with
others on a document. In this course, you'll be given a lot of
keyboard commands. If you ever need help with finding an action while
you're working on a document, press **Alt + Slash**. That will open a
search bar where you can search for an action to perform, like
creating a link, or a list. Use your up and down arrows to choose an
action, and **Enter** to activate the one you're on.

In this lesson, you'll learn how to:

- Open Google Docs
- Navigate the Docs interface
- Create a document
- Close a document

## Open Google Docs

To open Google Docs, in a web browser, open a new window, or new tab
if that's your preference. On Windows, or Chrome devices like
ChromeBooks, press **Control + N**. On Mac, press **Command + N**. In
this course, we'll assume you're either using Microsoft Edge, or
Google Chrome.

Now, you have a new Window. Move to the address bar, on Windows or
Chrome devices with **Control + L**, or on Mac with **Command + L**.
Here, type the address docs.google.com and press **Enter**, on
Windows or Chrome devices, or **Return** on Mac. If you're already in
the address bar, don't worry about trying to get there again.

Now, your screen reader should move to the "Recent documents" list. If
it doesn't, try to **Tab** or **shift + Tab** to it. It should say
"recent Documents, list". This list contains documents that you've
worked on recently.

## Navigate the Docs interface

When you open Google Docs, you land on the Recent Documents
list. However, that isn't the only item on the page. Take some time to
explore what's on the page, using the **Tab** key. After the Open File
Picker button, you'll find the browser interface, and then the top
part of the Google Docs page, where the controls continue.

Create new document
:   This creates a new text document. The dialog for choosing a template opens.

Filter options
:   Allows you to filter the list of documents

Sort options
:   Allows you to sort the documents in the list.

Open File picker
:   Allows you to open a file from Google Drive.

Google Account
:   Allows one to change the Google account currently signed into Google Docs on the computer.

List view
:   Allows you to change the view of documents to a list.

Grid view
:   Allows you to change the list of documents to a grid.

Main Menu
:   This opens a menu containing other Google apps, like Sheets, slides, forms, and also has a "settings" item.

search
:   Allows you to search your documents.

## Create a Document

To create a document, simply Tab to the "create New document" button
and press **Enter**. A list of templates will open, press **Enter** on
"Blank". A new document will open, ready to be written.

## Configuring accessibility

In Docs, screen reader mode must be enabled. To do this, press
**Control + Alt + Z**. You'll hear "screen reader mode enabled." Now,
you can use Docs fairly well, but for better access, even if you don't
have a Braille Display, you should turn on Braille Support. To do
that, press **Control + Alt + H**. If that doesn't work, perform the
following steps:

- Press **Alt + T** to open the Tools menu. If that doesn't work, press **Alt + Shift + T**.
- Press **Up Arrow** to reach "accessibility settings."
- Tab until you hear "enable braille support", and press the SpaceBar to check the check box. If the box is already checked, skip to the next step.
- Tab to the "ok" button, and press **Enter**.

## Close a Document

To close a document, simply close its Window, or navigate to a different page. You do *not* have to save your work, it is saved automatically.
