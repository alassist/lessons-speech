# Lesson 9: Getting Started with Google Docs with a screen reader

In this lesson, you'll learn how to:

- Open Google Docs
- Navigate the Docs interface
- Create a document
- Close a document

## Open Google Docs

To open Google Docs, in a web browser, open a new window, or new Tab tab if
that's your preference. On Windows, press **Control + N**. On Mac,
press **Command + N**. On Chrome devices, press **Control + N**. In
this course, we'll assume you're either using Microsoft Edge, or
Google Chrome.

Now, you have a new Window. Move to the address bar, on Windows with
**Control + L**, on Mac with **Command + L**, and Chrome devices with
**Control + L**. Here, type the address docs.google.com and press
**Enter**, on Windows or Chrome devices, or **Return** on Mac. If
you're already in the address bar, don't worry about trying to get
there again.

Now, your screen reader should move to the "Recent documents" list. If
it doesn't, try to **Tab** or **shift + Tab** to it. It should say
"recent Documents, list". This list contains documents that you've
worked on recently.

## Navigate the Docs interface

When you open Google Docs, you land on the Recent Documents
list. However, that isn't the only item on the page. Take some time to
explore what's on the page, using the **Tab** key. After the Open File
Picker button, you'll find the browser interface, and then the top
part of the Google Docs page, where the controls continue.

Create new document
:   This creates a new text document. The dialog for choosing a template opens.

Filter options
:   Allows you to filter the list of documents

Sort options
:   Allows you to sort the documents in the list.

Open File picker
:   Allows you to open a file from Google Drive.

Google Account
:   Allows one to change the Google account currently signed into Google Docs on the computer.

List view
:   Allows you to change the view of documents to a list.

Grid view
:   Allows you to change the list of documents to a grid.

Main Menu
:   This opens a menu containing other Google apps, like Sheets, slides, forms, and also has a "settings" item.

search
:   Allows you to search your documents.

## Create a Document

To create a document, simply Tab to the "create New document" button
and press **Enter**. A list of templates will open, press **Enter** on
"Blank". A new document will open, ready to be written.

## Configuring accessibility

In Docs, screen reader mode must be enabled. To do this, press
**Control + Alt + Z**. You'll hear "screen reader mode enabled." Now,
you can use Docs fairly well, but for better access, even if you don't
have a Braille Display, you should turn on Braille Support. To do
that, press **Control + Alt + H**. If that doesn't work, perform the
following steps:

- Press **Alt + T** to open the Tools menu. If that doesn't work, press **Alt + Shift + T**.
- Press **Up Arrow** to reach "accessibility settings."
- Tab until you hear "enable braille support", and press the SpaceBar to check the check box. If the box is already checked, skip to the next step.
- Tab to the "ok" button, and press **Enter**.

## Close a Document

To close a document, simply close its Window, or navigate to a different page. You do *not* have to save your work, it is saved automatically.
