# Sharing and collaborating on files

Google Drive makes sharing your files simple. It also allows multiple
people to edit the same file, allowing for real-time
collaboration.

## Sharing files

Whenever you share a file from your Google Drive, you can let others
view and even edit that same file. While you can share any file stored
on your Google Drive, it's important to note that you can only use the
collaboration features for files that can be opened in Google apps,
like Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides.

Let's look at the example of Olenna, an art teacher who uses her
Google Drive to organize letters, lesson plans, and more. Olenna's
files include:

- **Files she keeps private**, like her spreadsheet with classroom
  expenses
- **Files she lets others edit**, like the lesson-planning documents
  she creates with her co-teacher
- **Files she shares publicly and doesn't let others edit**, like the
  newsletters and announcements she shares with her students and their
  parents
- **Files others share with her**, including ones she can edit, like
  her co-teacher's supply inventory; and ones she can't, like a
  schedule sent to her by the principal

As you can tell, no single sharing setting would be right for all of
Olenna's files. The settings you choose for each of your shared files
will probably depend on why you're sharing it in the first place.

When you share a file with a limited group of people, your
collaborators must sign in with a Google account to view or edit the
file. However, when you share with a larger group or make the file
public, your collaborators will not need a Google account to access
the file.

## To share a file with a limited group of people:

1. Locate and select the file you want to share, then press the
   "Share" button. If using a screen reader in Focus mode, press
   **Control + Alt + A** to open the share dialog box.
2. A dialog box will appear. In the People box, type the email
   addresses of the people you'd like to share the file with. If you
   want, you can add a message that will be emailed to the people you
   share the file with.
3. Press **Enter** on *Send*. Your file will be shared.

For more control over your files, you can open the drop-down box to
decide whether people can *edit, comment on, or simply view* the
file.

## Sharing with a link

You can easily share a file with a larger group of people by providing
a link to any file in your Google Drive. A link is basically a URL or
web address for any file you want to share. This can be especially
helpful for files that would be too large to send as an email
attachment, like music or video files. You can also share a file by
posting the link to a public webpage. Anyone who clicks the link will
be redirected to the file.

## To share a link:

1. Locate and select the file you want to share, then press
   **Control + Alt + A**.
2. A dialog box will appear. Press **Enter** on Copy link.
3. A link to the file will be copied to your web clipboard. You can
   then paste the link in an email message or on the Web to share the
   file. When you're finished, click Done.

### Files shared with you

People can also choose to share files with you. These files will
appear in your Shared with Me folder. However, if you'd prefer to
access a file from your Google Drive without switching to this view,
you can move it. To do this, navigate to your **Shared with Me**
folder, hover the mouse over the desired file, then select **Add to My
Drive**.

### Collaboration tools

Whenever you share a file in a Google Drive format, you'll have the
option to allow your co-editors to change and edit the file. Google
Drive offers several tools that enhance collaboration by making it
easier to communicate with your co-editors and to see which changes
have been made and by whom.

## Suggesting mode

Google Drive also has a feature called Suggesting mode, which is
similar to the Track Changes feature in Microsoft Office. This allows
each collaborator to make changes, while giving the other
collaborators a chance to review the changes before making them
permanent. [This page][7] has more information about how to make
suggested edits and accept or reject other people's changes.
