# Lesson 12: Cleaning up Your Document

Now that you know how to add and edit your document, we'll cover how
to clean up any misspellings, wrong word choices, and grammar
problems.

## Spell checking

To check for misspelled words, on Windows, press **Control +
apostrophe**. On Mac, press **Command + apostrophe**. To search
backward, press **Control + Semicolon** on Windows, or **Command +
Semicolon** on Mac. Google Docs automatically performs spell-checking
on the document, so you don't have to press F7 if you don't want
to. However, if you want to spell check the whole document, using a
dialog box to correct issues, you can press **F7** to spell check,
just like in Word. When you find a spelling error when you're moving
around your document, open the Google
Docs context menu, arrow to the suggestion that you want, and press
**Enter** to correct it. Note that Google Docs checks grammar as well
as spelling, so move to the next or previous error will move to both
spelling and grammar errors. Note also that Google Docs is just a
computer program, and its algorithms for spelling and grammar checking
are not perfect, so do not automatically accept Google Docs'
corrections without considering their context.

## Find and Replace

To find content in your document, press **Control + F** on Windows, or
**Command + F** on a Mac. Type what you want to find, and either press
**Escape** when it is found (Docs will search as you type), or
**Enter** to search again. To find and replace, press *Control + H**
on Windows, or **Command + Shift + H** on Mac. Now, type what you want
to find in the "find" field, what you want to replace it with in the
"replace" field, then use the buttons passed those fields to control
the process, and **Escape** when you're done.
