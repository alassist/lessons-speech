# Lesson 13: Utilities

In this lesson, we'll cover other utilities that can help you through the process of writing documents, or plan them.

## Explore

Explore is a part of Google Docs that helps you find relevant images and information, and add them to your document. You can access Explore with **Control + Alt + Shift + I** for Windows, and **Command + Option + shift + I** on Mac. This will open a page that you can browse through, so on Windows, with NVDA, press **Insert + Space** until you hear a beep, then read the page. If there is nothing on it, press **Escape** and add more to the document if you'd like to use this feature. If you find something, follow the instructions on the page to "add" it, or "insert it." When you're done with the Explore page, press **Escape** to move back to your document.

## Calendar, Keep, and Tasks

You can use Google Calendar, Keep, and Tasks in a side panel while using Docs. The tools in the side panel are collapsed, by default. To go to the side panel and expand one of the tools, follow these steps:

1. Windows, **Control + Alt + Comma**, or Mac, **Command + Option + Comma**. You can also use period in place of comma to move in the opposite direction.

2. Use Arrow keys to move to the tool you want to use, then press **Enter** to open one.

3. In the side panel, you can now do the following actions, without leaving your document:

  - Calendar: View your daily schedule, click events to edit them, create new events, and jump to upcoming events.

  - Keep: Create checklists and take notes.

  - Tasks: Add to-do's and deadlines.

4. To move back to the Document, use the same commands you used to get into the side panel menu: **Control + Alt + Period/Comma** on Windows, or **Command + Option + Period/Comma** on Mac.

5. To close the side panel, press **Shift + Tab** until you find the Close button, and press **Enter**.
