### Locked out of your Google account?

There may be times when you go to log in to Gmail, Google Docs, or any other Google site and can't seem to remember the email address or password you used when creating your account. Luckily, Google makes it easy to recover your account information.

However, you will need some information to recover your account, whether it's your **email address**, **the date you created your account**, or your **phone number**.

#### To recover your user name:

If you don't use your email address often or if you never wrote it down, you might one day find that you've forgotten it. Google makes it easy to recover your user name.  

1. Go to the [Google sign-in page][1] and click **Need help?** below the login field.

2. Click **Find my account**.

3. Select either **Enter your recovery email address** or **Enter your recovery phone number**, then type your name and check off the box next to **I'm not a robot**. Click **Submit**.![][4]
4. Google will send you an email or text message containing your user name.

#### To recover your password:

If you know your user name but can't remember your password, you can **reset** your password to something else.  

1. Go to the [Google sign-in page][1] and click **Need help?** below the login field.

3. Enter the last password you can remember, then click **Next**. If you can't remember one, click **Try a different question**. Other options will become available, including entering the **month** and **year** you created the account or sending a** verification code** to your recovery email address.

4. If you have a recovery email address, you will be sent a verification code to reset your password. If you don't, you will be asked to type an email address where you can receive a code.
5. Once you receive the code, type it and click **Next**.
