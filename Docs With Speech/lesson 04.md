# Uploading and syncing files

Google Drive makes it easy to store and access your files online in
the cloud, allowing you to access them from any computer with an
Internet connection. If you upload files from compatible programs like
Microsoft Word or Excel, you can even edit them in Google Drive.

## Uploading files to Google Drive

Google Drive gives you 15 gigabytes (15 GB) free storage space to
upload files from your computer and store them in the cloud. There are
two main types of files you can store on your Google Drive:

- Files you can edit, like Microsoft Office files, PDFs, and other
  text-based files
- Files you cannot edit, like music, videos, compressed archives (.zip
  files), and most other files

Once you upload a file--no matter what type of file it is--you'll be
able to manage, organize, share, and access it from anywhere. And
because the files on Google Drive are synced across your devices,
you'll always see the most recent version of a file.

You can also preview many file types, even if you don't have the
software required for that file on your computer. For example, you can
use Google Drive to preview a Photoshop file, even if Photoshop is not
installed on your current computer.

## Converting files to Google Drive formats

If you are uploading files you plan to edit online, you will need to
convert them to Google Drive format. Converting allows you to edit a
file and collaborate with others easily. Only certain file types--like
Microsoft Office files and PDF documents--can be converted to Google
Drive formats. You can now edit Microsoft Office files on Google
Drive. This feature is still new, so when you open an Office file,
you'll be asked to enable the feature. You can still choose to convert
an Office file to Google Drive formats.

Unfortunately, this conversion isn't always perfect. Depending on the
level of formatting used in the original document, the converted
document could turn out looking quite different.

Conversion changes aren't always just cosmetic--you may even lose
information from the original file. You should always review a file
that's been converted before sharing it with others. Remember, you
always have the option to store your files in their original file
format if you'd prefer not to edit files online.

# Uploading files and folders

It's easy to upload files from your computer to Google Drive. If
you're using the [Google Chrome][1] web browser, you can even upload
entire folders.

## To upload a file:

1. From Google Drive, locate and select the New button, then select
   File upload. Or, press **Alt + C, then U**.
2. Using the Open dialog box, find a file you want to open, and press
   **Enter** on it to open it. You can select multiple files.
3. The file(s) will be uploaded to your Google Drive.

## To upload a folder:

**Note**: This feature is only available if you're accessing Google
Drive through Google Chrome.

1. Press the New menu button, then select Folder upload. Or, press
   **Alt + C, then I**.
2. Locate and select the folder you want to upload. On Windows, select
   the folder, Tab to the folder name edit field, and press **Enter**.
3. The folder and the files within it will be uploaded to your Google
   Drive.
