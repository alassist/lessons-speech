### Creating a Google account

In order to use Google Drive, you will need a **Google account**. Google accounts are free, and signing up for one is fairly simple. In order to create a Google account, you'll need to enter some information, including your **name**, **birth date**, and **location**. Creating a Google account will automatically create a **Gmail** email address and a **Google+ profile**.

If you have a Gmail address, you **already have a Google account**, so you won't need to create an account—you can simply sign in to Drive using your Gmail information.

#### To create a Google account:

1. Go to [www.google.com][1]. Locate and select the **Sign in** button in the top-right corner of the page.

Just like with any online service, it's important to choose a **strong** **password**—in other words, one that's difficult for someone to guess. For more information, check out our [Password Tips][11] lesson.

### Accessing Google Drive

Once you've set up your Google account, you can access **Google Drive** by going to  in your web browser.

You can also navigate to Google Drive from any Google page (such as Gmail or Google search) by selecting the **grid icon** near the top-right corner, then clicking **Drive**.

### The Google Drive interface

Your Google Drive may be empty right now, but as you begin to **upload **and **create **files you'll need to know how to **view**, **manage**, and **organize **them in the** interface**.

Click the buttons in the interactive below to become familiar with the Google Drive interface.

### Google Drive for mobile devices

Available for both [iOS][13] and [Android][14], the **Google Drive mobile app** allows you to **view **and **upload** files to Google Drive using your mobile device.

Google also has separate mobile apps for **creating** and **editing** documents, spreadsheets, and presentations. To learn more, check out Google's blog post on [New mobile apps for Docs, Sheets, and Slides][16].

### Google Drive for desktop

If you prefer to work on the desktop, you can download the [Google Drive desktop app ][17]to your computer. Available for Windows and OS X, this app makes it a bit easier to upload your existing files and work offline. Once it's installed, you'll see a new Google Drive folder on your computer. Any files you move into this folder will automatically be uploaded to your Google Drive.
