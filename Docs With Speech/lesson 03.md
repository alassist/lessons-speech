# Creating new files

Google Drive gives you access to a suite of tools that allows you to create and edit a variety of files, including documents, spreadsheets, and presentations. There are five types of files you can create on Google Drive:

- **Documents**: For composing letters, flyers, essays, and other text-based files (similar to Microsoft Word documents)
- **Spreadsheets**: For storing and organizing information (similar to Microsoft Excel workbooks)
- **Presentations**: For creating slideshows (similar to Microsoft PowerPoint presentations)
- **Forms**: For collecting and organizing data
- **Drawings**: For creating simple vector graphics or diagrams

The process for creating new files is the same for all file types. Watch the video below to learn more.

## To create a new file:

1. From Google Drive, locate and select the New button, then choose the type of file you want to create. In our example, we'll select Google Docs to create a new document. To do this with a keyboard command, press **Alt + C, then T**.
2. Your new file will appear in a new tab on your browser. If you aren't already in the untitled document, press **Control + Tab** to reach the untitled document tab. Press **Alt + F** in Google Chrome, or **Alt + Shift + F** in other browsers, and select "rename."
3. The _Rename_ dialog box will appear. Type a name for your file, then click OK. For keyboard users, just type the name and press **Enter**.
4. Your file will be renamed. You can access the file at any time from your Google Drive, where it will be saved automatically. Simply navigate to it and press **Enter** to open it.

You may notice that there is no Save button for your files. This is because Google Drive uses autosave, which automatically and immediately saves your files as you edit them.

# Using templates

A template is a pre-designed file you can use to quickly create new documents. Templates often include custom formatting and designs, so they can save you a lot of time and effort when starting a new project. Most templates are designed to help you create specific types of files. For instance, you could use a template to quickly create a resume or newsletter.

You can find a wide selection of templates in the [Google Drive Template Gallery][7]. Unfortunately, we've found that many of these templates aren't very well-designed, and it's often difficult to find specific templates within the gallery. For this reason, we recommend using templates made by Google, which tend to be of higher quality than user-submitted templates.

## To use an official Google template:

1. Using **Shift + Tab**, navigate to the "new" button, and press **Enter**. Down arrow to the "google Docs" submenu, press **Enter**, down arrow to "from a template" and press **Enter**.
2. Templates are grouped into lists. Tab through the categories, and use arrow keys to select a template. When you've found a template you want to use, press **Enter** on it.
3. A new file will be created with the selected template. You can then customize the file with your own information.

# Challenge!

1. Make sure you're signed in to Google, and open the [Google Drive Template Gallery][7].
2. Find a template and press **Enter** on it to create a new file with that template.
3. Rename the file.
4. Try going back to your Google Drive to see that your new file has been added.
5. If you're on a desktop computer, add a file from your computer to your Google Drive.
