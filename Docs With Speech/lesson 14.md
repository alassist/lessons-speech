# Lesson 14: Collaborate!

In this lesson, you'll learn how to collaborate with other users of Google Docs.

## Share a file

To share a file, use the File Menu. Open the File menu, Arrow to Share, and press **Enter**. A dialog box will open. Here, type the name or email address of the people you want to share the document to. After each person's information, press **Tab** to move to a new place to Enter information for another person, or move to the next control. When finished, **Tab** to the Done button, and press **Enter**.

When you collaborate with other people, your screen reader will tell you when someone else begins or ends editing of the file along with you, as well as when they move into the same area that you're editing in.

To find edits made by other collaborators, press **Control + Alt + Shift + R** on Windows, or **Command + Option + Shift + R** Mac.

To open a chat window where you can chat with other people, press **Shift + Escape**.

If you want more information about collaborators and the individual changes they make, open the menu bar by pressing **Alt + F** Chrome on Windows, or **Alt + Shift + F** on other Windows browsers, or pass through a key on Mac using VoiceOver, then press **Control + Option + F**, then press **Shift + Tab** until you hear "collaborators".

To turn off collaboration alerts, go to the Tools menu, arrow up to Accessibility settings, and uncheck the "turn on colaborator announcements" setting.
