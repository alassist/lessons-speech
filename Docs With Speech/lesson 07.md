### Downloading and printing files from Google Drive

Once you've created a file, it will be accessible whenever you sign in to Google Drive. However, there may be times when you want to **download or print** a file for **offline access**.

#### To download a file:

1. Locate and right-click the file you want to download, then select **Download**.

2. The file will be downloaded to your computer.

#### To choose a file format:

By default, Google Drive will choose the most common file format whenever you download a file. For example, if you download a Google Document, it will automatically be saved as a **.docx** file, which is used by Microsoft Word and most other word processors. However, there may be times when you want to choose a different format, such as PDF.

1. Double-click the desired file to open it.

2. Select **File![right-arrow][3]Print**.

Note that these options will vary depending on the type of file you're printing. For example, you'll have different options for printing a spreadsheet than you would for printing a presentation.
