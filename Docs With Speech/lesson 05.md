### Managing your files

After you've been using Google Drive for a while, you might find yourself having a difficult time keeping track of all of your files. Fortunately, Drive offers several features to help you **manage** and **organize** them. Watch the video below to learn more.

#### Searching for files

**Searching** lets you look for specific files using words contained within the file or file name. To do this, locate the **search bar**, then enter the word or file name you're looking for. A list of suggested searches and files will appear as you type. Simply click a file to open it directly from the search results. You can also press the Enter key to see a full list of search results.

#### Sorting files

By default, your files are already sorted from newest to oldest. However, you can apply other sorts to put your files in a different order. To sort by name, click the **Name** button just above the list of files. To sort by date, click the **Last modified** button, then choose the desired sort option.

#### To apply a filter:

**Filters** let you hide unimportant files and focus only on the ones you're interested in. For example, if you were looking for a **presentation**, you could use a filter to **narrow down** your visible files so you would only see presentations.

1. Locate and select the **Search options arrow** in the search bar.

![Google Drive search options. ][3]

2. Choose the **filter **you want to use. In our example, we'll set a filter for **file type**.

3. Choose the desired filter. In our example, we'll select **Text documents**.

![Choosing desired search filter. ][5]

4. Click the **Search** button or press the **Enter** key to apply the filter.

![Search type documents. ][6]

5. Only files that **match** the filter will appear.

To **clear **a filter, select the text in search bar, then press the **Backspace** or **Delete** key.

### Organizing your files

Once you start adding files to Google Drive, you can use **folders** to help organize and group them. Folders in Google Drive work just like the folders on your computer.

#### To create a folder:

1. From Google Drive, click the **New** button, then select **Folder** from the drop-down menu.

![Creating a new folder. ][8]

2. A dialog box will appear. Enter a **name** for your folder, then click **Create**.

![][9]

3. Your folder will appear on the left below **My Drive**. You may need to click the **drop-down arrow** to see your folders.

#### To move files into folders:

1. Click and drag the file to the **desired folder**.

![Clicking and dragging file to folder. ][11]

2. The file will appear in the selected folder.

![File moved to folder. ][12]

To add **multiple files** to the same folder, press and hold the **Ctrl** key (or **Command** on a Mac), then click to select each desired file. When you're ready, click and drag the files to the desired folder.

![Selecting multiple files. ][13]

#### To delete a file:

Deleting a file from your Google Drive is similar to deleting a file from your computer. You will have to move the file to the **Trash folder** and then **delete it permanently**, just like you would delete a file from the Trash or Recycle Bin on your computer.

1. Select the **file** you want to delete, then click the **Remove** button to move the file to the Trash folder.

![][14]

2. Select** Trash **in the left navigation pane.

![][15]

3. The **Trash** folder will appear. Click **Trash** near the top of the screen, then select **Empty Trash**. The files will be permanently deleted.

![][16]

#### To preview a file:

Previewing files is a great way to make sure you're opening the right version of a file or to take a quick look at files without opening them.

1. Select the file you want to preview, then click the **Preview** button.

![][17]

2. A **preview** of the file will appear.

![][18]

#### Right-clicking

Right-clicking allows you to access the full list of actions for any file. Most of the actions listed here are accessible in other places on Google Drive, but it serves as a great shortcut.
