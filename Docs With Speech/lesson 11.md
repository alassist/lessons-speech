# Lesson 11: Formatting Your Document

In Google Docs, you can format your document in many ways. You can
make parts italicized, bold, and several other formats. In this
lesson, you'll learn how this is done.

Formatting in Google Docs is similar to Microsoft Word; if you've gone
through that course, you'll feel at home in Docs. You can format words
or characters in two ways:

1. Type the word or words to be formatted, select them, then apply a format to them.
2. Turn on the format you'd like to write in, like italics, then write the word or words to be formatted, then turn off the formatting.

To get a list of formatting characteristics that can be applied,
simply use the format menu. In Chrome on Windows, press **Alt + O**.
On Windows with other browsers, use **Alt + Shift + O**. On Mac,
press **VO + Tab** for "Pass through", then **Control + Option + O**.

This is very helpful to learn keyboard commands. As Google Docs
changes, you'll never miss a new feature, or be unpleasantly surprised
by a change. Using the menu system for Docs is important to learn its
features.

## Searching the menus

If you cannot find a command you're looking for, you can search the
menus. This is similar to the "Tell me" feature in Microsoft Word. To
do this, press **Alt + / (slash)** on Windows, or **Option + /
(slash)** on Mac. Type what you want to search for, like "Insert"arrow
through the results to find the one you want, and press **Enter**.

## Formatting with Markdown

Google Docs has introduced a convenient feature that allows users to
format their documents using Markdown, a lightweight markup
language. Markdown enables you to write plain text that is easily
converted to formatted text. This feature automatically converts
Markdown syntax into rich text as you type, streamlining the
formatting process.

### What is Markdown?

Markdown is a simple and intuitive text format that makes it easy to
create cleanly formatted documents. It was originally created to
provide a straightforward method for writers, allowing them to
concentrate on their content without worrying too much about
formatting. Markdown is widely used because it is both human-readable
and machine-readable.

### Basic Markdown Syntax

Here are a few essential Markdown items and how they translate to formatting in Google
Docs:

1. *Headings*: Headings keep your document organized. Put these
   simples as the first thing on an empty line, and they'll be
   transformed into headings once you press Space.
   - Use the `#` symbol, accessed by pressing Shift + 3, to create
     headings. The number of `#` symbols indicates the heading
     level. For example:
     - `# Heading 1` transforms to a main heading.
     - `## Heading 2` becomes a subheading.
     - `### Heading 3` and so on.
   
2. *Bold*:
   - Wrap text with double asterisks (`**`) to make it bold. For
     instance:
     - `**bold text**` converts to bold text.

3. *Italics*:
   - Use single asterisks (`*`) to italicize. For example:
     - `*italic text*` results in italic text.
   
4. *Lists*, note that once you start a list, you don't have to
   continuously write numbers on the next lines. When you're ready to
   end a list, press **Enter** twice.
   - Create ordered lists using numbers followed by a period. For example:
     - `1. First item`
     - `2. Second item`
   - For unordered lists, use asterisks (`*`), plus (`+`), or hyphens (`-`). For example:
     - `* Item one`
     - `- Item two`
     - `+ Item three`

5. *Links*:
   - Format links using square brackets for the link text and
     parentheses for the web address:
     - `[Google](https://www.google.com)` will become a clickable link.

### How to Use Markdown in Google Docs

To make the most of Markdown formatting in Google Docs, follow these simple steps:

1. Begin typing in Markdown syntax as specified above.
2. As you type, Google Docs automatically detects the Markdown syntax
and converts it to the appropriate formatting.
3. If necessary, you can manually adjust any formatting using the traditional methods described
earlier in this lesson.

Using Markdown in Google Docs allows you to maintain focus on content while quickly and efficiently
applying formatting. This feature is especially beneficial for those familiar with Markdown from
other platforms, or for those who prefer keyboard-centric workflows.

By incorporating Markdown, Google Docs provides users with additional flexibility and efficiency in
creating well-formatted documents. Experiment with these features to see how they can improve your
document creation processes.
