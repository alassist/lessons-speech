# Lesson 11: Formatting Your Document

In Google Docs, you can format your document in many ways. You can make parts italicized, bold, and several other formats. In this lesson, you'll find out how this is done.

Formatting in Google Docs is similar to Microsoft Word; if you've gone through that course, you'll feel at home in Docs. You can format words or characters in two ways:

1. Type the word or words to be formatted, select them, then apply a format to them.

2. Turn on the format you'd like to write in, like italics, then write the word or words to be formatted, then turn off the formatting.

To get a list of formatting characteristics that can be applied, simply use the format menu. In Chrome on Windows, press **Alt + O**. On Windows with other browsers, use **Alt + Shift + O**. On Mac, press **VO + Tab** for "Pass through", then **Control + Option + O**.

This is very helpful to learn keyboard commands. As Google Docs changes, you'll never miss a new feature, or be unpleasantly surprised by a change. Using the menu system for Docs is important to learn its features.

# Searching the menus

If you cannot find a command you're looking for, you can search the menus. This is similar to the "Tell me" feature in Microsoft Word. To do this, press **Alt + / (slash)** on Windows, or **Option + / (slash)** on Mac. Type what you want to search for, like "Insert"arrow through the results to find the one you want, and press **Enter**.
