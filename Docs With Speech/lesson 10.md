# Lesson 10: Basic editing

In this lesson, you'll learn how to:

- Move around a document
- Use quick movement commands
- Use the Menu Bar
- Search for commands

## Move around the Document

Google Docs is similar to other word processing programs you've
probably used in the past, such as Microsoft Word, Apple Pages, or
LibreOffice. This means that, while more advanced features are slightly
different, the basics are not much different from any other text editor.

Create a new document, using the steps you learned in lesson nine, and
type some text. Now, use the arrow keys to move around the document. You
can select parts of a file, just as you do in other edit fields. You can
copy with **Control + C**, cut with **Control + X**, paste with
**Control + V**, and so on. You can Undo, Redo, insert a link, make
selections italic, bold, underlined, superscript, subscript, and a lot
more.

On a Mac, you can use **Command + C** to copy, **Command + X** to cut,
and **Command + V** to paste.

Note that some actions are applied to a character or word, like italics
and bold, and some to a whole paragraph, like creating a heading or
list. For more keyboard commands for editing, see [this comprehensive
list](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/179738?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&oco=1).

To move to the top of your file, use **Control + Home** on Windows or
**Search + Up Arrow** on ChromeOS. Make a new line with the **Enter**
key, press **Up Arrow** to go to the new line, and type a heading for
your document.

On a Mac, you can move to the top of your file using **Command + Up
Arrow**.

Headings are useful for sighted readers and for navigation. Having
headings where needed can make navigating your document faster. For
example, at the beginning of this lesson, there is the "Lesson 10:
Basic editing" heading. This heading is at level one, meaning that it
is the most important heading, providing the first point of interest.

To create a heading, after typing one for your document, press
**Control + Alt + 1**.

On a Mac, use **Control + Option + 1** to create a heading.

## Use Quick Movement commands

Google Docs allows quick navigation between sections like headings. For
NVDA, Google Docs' screen reader mode conflicts with the default NVDA
startup command **Control + Alt + N**. If you must change it:

1.  Press **Windows + D** to go to the desktop.
2.  Press "n" to find the "NVDA" icon.
3.  Press **Alt + Enter** to open the "properties" dialog.
4.  Press **Tab** until you hear "hotkey field".
5.  Enter a different shortcut key than **Control + Alt + N**. Google
    recommends **Control + Alt + Backslash**, but **Control + Alt + Shift + N** may work too.
6.  Press **Tab** until you hear "ok" button, and press **Enter**.
7.  If a dialog asks for administrative consent to change the setting,
    press **Enter**.

If NVDA isn't on your desktop, using the quick navigation commands
directly without altering settings is recommended.

Note that you must maintain the press of the modifier keys when pressing
N or P, then the character key. This is consistent across all operating
systems. If you cannot change the NVDA Startup command, navigate by
pressing **Alt + A** in your document, select the item type you want,
press **Right Arrow**, then select either "next" or "previous" item
type, like **Alt + A, H, N** for headings.

## Use the Menu Bar

The Menu Bar appears at the top of the Google Docs window and includes:

-   **File:** Manage your document, including sharing, downloading, and
    more.
-   **Edit:** Undo, redo, find, and other editing commands.
-   **View:** Adjust layout, editing mode, etc.
-   **Insert:** Insert various elements like images or links.
-   **Format:** Format text, paragraphs, add headers/footers/lists.
-   **Tools:** Access spelling, grammar, word count, and more.
-   **Add-ons:** View installed add-ons.
-   **Help:** Search commands, access help topics.
-   **Accessibility:** Access quick commands and collaboration info.

In Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome, press **Alt + F** to access the
"file" menu. Use the right arrow to cycle through menu items or down
arrow for sub-items.

In Firefox or other browsers, press **Alt + Shift + F** then follow
similar navigation steps.

On a Mac, with VoiceOver on, press **VO + Tab** to send the next key
command to Safari, then press **Control + Option + F** to open the file
menu. On Chrome devices, use **Alt + F** to access the file menu.

## Search for commands

To search for a command, press **Alt + Slash**.

On a Mac, use **Command + Slash**.

Navigate to the search edit field and type in the command name or
category you want to search for, such as "link". After typing, press
**Enter** to view results. Navigate these using arrow keys. If
necessary, adjust screen reader mode to interact with search results,
and close the dialog with **Escape**. Try finding the command to
insert a link using the Search Commands feature.
