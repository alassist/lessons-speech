# Basics of Using VoiceOver

Now that you have VoiceOver enabled, you can begin using it. The first
thing you'll learn is how to reach the home screen. The home screen is
the place where you have all of your apps. 

Moving to the home screen involves different steps depending on if you
have a home button or not. If you do, just press the home button
once. If you don't, touch the bottom of the screen, and while you have
your finger on the screen, slide your finger up.

When you slide your finger up, you'll feel a vibration and hear a pop
sound from the phone. Once you hear that, release your finger. You'll
then be taken to the home screen.

## Navigating the Home screen

Now that you've gotten to the home screen, you can begin navigating
through it. VoiceOver typically puts focus onto the top left item on
the home screen. Note that this isn't the status bar, which is
different, but is either the first app on the screen, or the Weather
widget if that is on the screen and is the first item.
