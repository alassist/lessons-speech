# Lesson 2

In this lesson, you'll learn to run on your phone, and use Siri.

When you first get your iPhone, it will be turned off. To turn it on, find the Power button. It will be the only button on one side of the phone. Press and hold this button to turn it on.

On newer iPhones, you'll hear a sound and feel a vibration when the phone starts to turn on. Once this happens, let go of the power button. On older phones, press and hold the Power button for about 3 seconds. Then, release the Power button.

After this, the phone will turn on. Give it about a minute to turn on. Then, you can turn on VoiceOver.

To turn on VoiceOver, find the Power button, and press it three times quickly. You'll hear VoiceOver say "VoiceOver on." Then, the phone will tell you that VoiceOver changes the taps and other commands you use on your phone. Feel around the screen with one finger until you find the OK button, and tap twice to activate it.

## Basics of VoiceOver

VoiceOver is a screen reader that reads what's on your phone screen aloud. It does not complete tasks for you, but allows you to operate your phone without sight. To go that, VoiceOver allows you to move your finger around the screen to find items displayed on it. To choose an item you've found, tap twice quickly. This will get you through 90% of all interactions you'll be doing with the iPhone.
