# Lesson One: Introduction and Overview

Welcome to the iPhone with Speech course. In this course, you will learn to use the Apple iPhone with the built-in VoiceOver screen reader. VoiceOver is an accessibility service that allows you to use your iPhone without sight. It works by allowing you to feel around the screen, speaking whatever your finger touches. You can then perform commands to activate items, learn more about them, change VoiceOver settings, quickly move around, and other such commands.

First, we'll learn about the hardware of the device; what's on the outside of the phone. Then we'll learn how to use Siri, the built-in voice assistant. Next, we'll learn basic VoiceOver commands and features. After that, we'll learn to use the VoiceOver rotor navigation feature. Then, we'll learn about the VoiceOver settings and what they do. Finally, you'll learn tips and tricks, and ways to get the most out of your iPhone and VoiceOver experience.

## The Front of the iPhone

First, place the iPhone with the screen facing upward. You can tell if the side you're holding up is the screen or not if you feel a round protrusion on one of the edges of the phone. That protrusion is the camera, and should be on the bottom of the device, on the top right edge. The screen is flat and rectangular. Depending on the model of iPhone you have, the screen will be completely flat with no irregularities, or have a small button on the bottom centre of the screen. This button is called the home button.

At the top of the screen is an earpiece, and is also where the front-facing camera is. This is another way that you can make sure that the iPhone is oriented correctly. Take some time to familiarize yourself with this surface; how wide and tall it is. You'll be touching this part of the phone the most.

## The bottom of the iPhone

Moving your hand down the screen and to the bottom of the device, you'll find a rectangular hole. This is the charging port. You can use this to easily charge your phone. The plug it comes with can be inserted into the phone either way, unlike older cables. Do not force it in if it doesn't fit, however. There are other types of charging chords that feel similar, and the one you hold may not be the correct one, if you have many devices. You can also use this port for plugging in accessories, like a flash drive, headphones, or a game controller.

On older models, you'll also have a headphone jack. This is not included in newer models, after the iPhone 6S. You can still use Lightning headphones, or Bluetooth headphones, like Apple Air Pods.

## The Back of the iPhone

The back of an iPhone is made of glass or ceramic material and features the device's camera, flash, and Apple logo. The camera is in the top left or right corner of the device, while the flash is located just below the camera. The Apple logo is centred on the back of the device. Depending on the model of iPhone, there may also be additional markings or text on the back of the device, such as regulatory information.

## The Side of the iPhone

The side of the iPhone is where you'll find the volume buttons and the mute switch. The volume buttons are located on the left side of the device. The mute switch is above the volume buttons, and is used to silence incoming calls, alarms, and other notifications. This is a physical switch, so you can easily turn it on and off.

On the right side of the iPhone is the power button. On iPhone models with a home button, the power button is used to lock the device, or turn it off, or make emergency calls. On models without the home button, the side button is used to summon Siri, turn on or off a selected accessibility service, or lock the device.
