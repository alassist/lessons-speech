# Lesson 2

In this lesson, you'll learn how to turn on VoiceOver, turn off
VoiceOver, and explore the screen.

## Turning On VoiceOver

There are several ways to turn on VoiceOver, depending on which iPhone
you have and whether your iPhone is new or not. Since there are many
methods to activate VoiceOver, this lesson will cover them from the
most common to the least common.

The first option is to tell Siri to "turn on VoiceOver." To do that,
you'll need to know if your phone has a Home button or not. To check
this, recall from the last lesson where the screen of your phone
is. Find the bottom of the screen, and if you feel a button there, you
have a Home button. If you do not, you do not have a Home button, and
you will use the Side button, or Power button as it used to be called.

If your phone has a Home button, you can turn on VoiceOver by holding
down the button until you hear a sound or feel a vibration. Tell Siri
to "Turn on VoiceOver," and then release the Home button. Siri will
respond that VoiceOver is now on, and VoiceOver will start.

If your phone does not have a Home button, you'll use the Side
button. This button is the button on the right side of the
phone, near the earpiece. Hold down the Side button until you hear a sound or feel a
vibration, then tell Siri to "Turn on VoiceOver," and release the
button. Siri will respond that VoiceOver is now on, and VoiceOver will
start.

The next option is to use the *Accessibility Shortcut*. The
accessibility shortcut allows you to quickly turn on and off
accessibility features, including VoiceOver. It's important to know
when you are able to use this. When you're first setting up your
phone, you can use the accessibility shortcut. However, if your phone
has been set up without VoiceOver being used, you cannot use the
shortcut, and must set it up manually. This will be discussed later,
when the course reviews accessibility settings.

For now, though, remember that the accessibility shortcut is an
option. To use it, press the Side button or Home button three
times. This will turn on the accessibility feature you have set to
it. If you have chosen more than one feature, it will open a list
where you can turn one of them on or off. When first setting up the
device, it will turn on VoiceOver.

The next option for turning on VoiceOver is to turn it on manually through the Settings
app. If VoiceOver is not already on, and Siri is not working, and the
Accessibility shortcut is not set up, then you'll need sighted
assistance to enable VoiceOver.

To turn on VoiceOver from the Settings app, you'll need to get to the
Home screen. Afterwards, open the Settings app. From there, choose
Accessibility from the list of categories. From there, choose
VoiceOver. On the screen is a switch to turn on or off
VoiceOver. Slide the switch to the On position, and VoiceOver will
begin speaking.
