## Course Outline: Using an iPhone with VoiceOver

This course aims to provide a foundational understanding and practical skills for using an iPhone when unable to see the screen, focusing on Apple's built-in screen reader, VoiceOver. The course is structured to move from basic concepts and setup to more advanced interactions and features.

### Module 1: Introduction to VoiceOver and the iPhone

* **What is VoiceOver?**
  * VoiceOver is a **gesture-based screen reader** that allows you to use an iPhone even if you cannot see the screen.
  * It provides **audible descriptions of what's on your screen**.
  * Examples include hearing the battery level, who is calling, or what item your finger is on.
* **Using iPhone without Seeing the Screen:**
  * It might sound unusual to use a device with a primary touch input surface without seeing the screen, but it is possible and can **increase independence and improve quality of life**.
  * This guide focuses on the **central concepts** of using iOS with VoiceOver, rather than specific features.
  * Mastering a few core concepts allows those skills to be applied to **accomplish a wide variety of tasks** in both first and third-party apps.
* **Terminology:**
  * **iOS** is the operating system that powers the iPhone. Until 2019, it also powered the iPad.
  * **iPadOS** is the version of iOS for the iPad, forked off in 2019, providing similar functionality to iOS with tablet-specific features. If you've used an iPhone, the iPad may feel familiar because the features are similar.

### Module 2: Getting Started and Basic Setup

* **Turning on the iPhone:**
  * Press and hold the **Side button for about five seconds** to turn on the iPhone.
* **Turning on VoiceOver:**
  * After the iPhone turns on (about a minute later), you can turn VoiceOver on by **pressing the Home button three times quickly**.
  * If your iPhone does not have a Home button, you press the **Side button three times quickly**.
  * VoiceOver should announce "**VoiceOver on**".
  * On iPhones without a Home button, a dialog describing alternative gestures will briefly appear. You need to **double-tap the OK button** in this dialog.
* **Initial Setup Process:**
  * Once VoiceOver is on and any initial dialogs are dismissed, you can begin the setup process by either pressing the Home button or sliding your finger up from the bottom edge of the screen (on iPhones without a Home button).
  * If your iPhone wasn't set up in the store, you will be walked through a brief setup process after turning it on.
* **Inserting a SIM (if required):**
  * On some carriers outside the U.S., you might need to insert a physical SIM card to connect to the cellular network.
  * This involves poking a recessed hole on the side of the iPhone with a paperclip and placing/aligning the SIM in the tray.
  * It is recommended to **check with the retailer** if the SIM can be inserted at the time of purchase if you cannot see.
* **Unlocking iPhone with VoiceOver On:**
  * When VoiceOver is on, special gestures are needed to unlock the iPhone.
  * On an iPhone with **Face ID**: Wake iPhone, glance at it, then **drag up from the bottom edge of the screen** until you feel a vibration or hear two rising tones.
  * On an iPhone with **Touch ID**: **Press the Home button** using the registered finger.
  * If prompted, you may need to **enter your passcode**. To avoid the passcode being spoken, you can enter it silently using handwriting mode or type onscreen braille.
* **Home Screen:**
  * When you turn on and unlock an iPhone with VoiceOver on, you will be placed on the Home Screen.
  * The Home Screen is a **grid of apps and widgets** that can span multiple pages.
* **Initial Exploration (Using someone else's iPhone):**
  * If you are using someone else's iPhone, it's a good idea to ask them to unlock it so you can explore the Home Screen.
  * Also, **ask the owner before opening any apps**, as they might contain sensitive content.

### Module 3: Basic Navigation and Interaction

* **Exploring by Touch:**
  * If VoiceOver is on, **moving a finger around the screen should cause it to speak what that finger is touching**.
  * When you touch the screen or drag your finger over it, VoiceOver speaks the name of the item your finger is on, including icons and text.
* **Activating Items (Double-Tap):**
  * To open an app, or generally interact with an item (like a button or link), first move a finger to it so VoiceOver speaks its name.
  * Then, lift your finger and **tap anywhere on the screen twice quickly**.
  * This gesture is known as a **double-tap** and is used to activate the currently selected item. It is the equivalent of a single-tap for sighted users.
* **Navigating Sequentially (Swiping):**
  * In addition to exploring by touch, you can move VoiceOver focus directly to the **next item by swiping right with one finger**.
  * You can move VoiceOver focus directly to the **previous item by swiping left with one finger**.
  * To swipe, try **brushing the screen quickly** with your finger or fingers.
* **Accessing Control Center:**
  * Swipe down with three fingers.
* **Switching Apps:**
  * When VoiceOver is on, you need to use special gestures to switch apps.

### Module 4: Practicing and Learning VoiceOver

* **VoiceOver Help:**
  * From anywhere in the operating system, you can **double-tap the screen with four fingers quickly** to access VoiceOver Help.
  * In this mode, **performing a gesture will cause VoiceOver to speak its function**. This is similar to Keyboard Help on macOS or Input Help on NVDA for Windows.
  * If the four-finger double-tap is mistakenly interpreted as a three-finger double-tap, VoiceOver will announce "Speech off". Perform a three-finger double-tap to restore VoiceOver speech.
* **VoiceOver Tutorial:**
  * An **interactive tutorial** for learning gestures and basic VoiceOver concepts is available.
  * You can access it by going to **Settings > Accessibility > VoiceOver > VoiceOver tutorial**.
* **VoiceOver Practice Area:**
  * You can use the VoiceOver Practice area to **safely try out VoiceOver gestures and hear what they do**, without performing any action on the iPhone.
  * To access it with VoiceOver turned on, go to **Settings > Accessibility > VoiceOver**. Turn on VoiceOver, tap VoiceOver Practice, then double-tap to start.
  * You can practice the following gestures with one, two, three, and four fingers in this area: **Tap, Double tap, Triple tap, Swipe left, right, up, or down**.
  * Try different techniques to find what works best. If a gesture doesn't work, try a quicker movement, especially for double tap or swipe gestures.
  * For best results with multifinger gestures, touch the screen with some space between your fingers.
  * When finished practicing, tap Done, then double-tap to exit.
* **Customizing Gestures and Keyboard Shortcuts:**
  * VoiceOver gestures and keyboard shortcuts can be customized.

### Module 5: The VoiceOver Rotor

* **What is the Rotor?**
  * Besides exploring by touch and double-tapping, the VoiceOver **rotor is one of the most important concepts**.
  * It is used to **navigate by different levels of granularity** (like headings, links, words), perform **custom actions on elements**, and quickly change some **VoiceOver settings**.
  * Think of the rotor as a **circular dial**.
* **How to Use the Rotor:**
  * To "turn" the rotor, **place two fingers on the screen and rotate them either clockwise or counterclockwise**.
  * Alternatively, you can place one finger from one hand on the screen and make a circular motion with another finger from the other hand.
* **Controlling VoiceOver using the Rotor:**
  * The rotor is used to control VoiceOver by selecting options for navigation.
  * After selecting a rotor option, you **swipe up or down with one finger** to use it.

### Module 6: Braille Input and Displays

* **Braille Screen Input (BSI):**
  * If you prefer to type or navigate using a Braille keyboard, like a Perkins braille writer or Braille notetaker, you can use **Braille Screen Input (BSI) on iOS to mimic this experience**.
  * BSI allows you to **place your fingers on the screen the way you'd position them on a Braille keyboard**.
  * VoiceOver will **predict what dots of a braille cell you're typing**. For example, tapping the right side with one finger is interpreted as dot six, while tapping towards the left or center is interpreted as dot one.
  * To insert a space using BSI, **swipe right with one finger**.
  * To insert a line break using BSI, **swipe right with two fingers**.
  * To start BSI, with VoiceOver turned on, **place one finger from each hand at the top and bottom edges of the screen and double-tap**. You may need to enable "Use Activation Gestures" in Settings > Accessibility > VoiceOver > Braille > Braille Screen Input if this gesture doesn't work.
* **BSI Command Mode:**
  * In addition to typing text, BSI can be used to **navigate iOS using a series of braille commands**. These are similar to commands used to control a braille notetaker or display.
  * To cycle between braille entry and command mode when in BSI, **swipe left or right with three fingers**.
  * Alternatively, you can start BSI directly in command mode by **triple-tapping the top and bottom edges of the screen with two fingers**.
  * In Command mode, press K (using braille dots) to start Help, where pressing a braille dot will cause VoiceOver to speak its function. Press K again to exit Help.
  * You can view and edit BSI commands and gestures in Settings > Accessibility > VoiceOver > Commands > Braille Screen Input.
  * You can also set mode announcements to speak or play sounds when switching BSI modes.
* **Using a Hardware Braille Display:**
  * With VoiceOver, you can **connect a Bluetooth wireless refreshable braille display** to control and navigate iPhone and read what's on the screen.
  * The braille typed on the display is automatically translated into text, and the display shows what you're typing.
  * Both contracted and uncontracted braille are supported, along with many international braille tables.
  * To connect a braille display:
        1. Turn on the braille display.
        2. On iPhone, go to Settings > Bluetooth, turn on Bluetooth, then choose the display.
        3. On iPhone, go to Settings > Accessibility > VoiceOver > Braille, then choose the display.
  * You can enable Bluetooth on Start so it automatically turns on with VoiceOver for braille displays.
  * To see the braille commands for controlling iPhone, go to Settings > Accessibility > VoiceOver > Braille, tap More Info, then tap Braille Commands.
  * You can change braille display settings in Settings > Accessibility > VoiceOver > Braille.
  * Closed captions during media playback can be output in braille. Go to Settings > Accessibility > VoiceOver > Verbosity, and choose Braille or Speech and Braille.
  * If you use a supported 2D braille display, you can use the rotor (specifically the Braille Text Mode rotor) to switch between different output modes, such as displaying images or reading text on multiple lines.

### Module 7: Operating Specific iPhone Functions with VoiceOver

* When VoiceOver is on, you need special gestures to operate core iPhone functions.
* These include gestures to unlock iPhone, go to the Home Screen, open Control Center, switch apps, and more.

### Module 8: Using VoiceOver in Apps

* VoiceOver can be used in **all the built-in apps** that come with your iPhone, such as Safari, Maps, and more.
* **VoiceOver Recognition:**
  * This feature allows you to get **descriptions of images and screen elements** in webpages and apps, even if they don’t provide accessibility information.
  * With VoiceOver Recognition, you can get descriptions of user interface elements in apps and on webpages, even if they don't provide accessibility information.
  * To turn on Screen Recognition (part of VoiceOver Recognition), go to **Settings > Accessibility > VoiceOver > VoiceOver Recognition**. Then turn on Screen Recognition.
* **Browsing the Web in Safari:**
  * With VoiceOver on, open the Safari app.
  * To search the web: Select the address field, double-tap to show the keyboard, then enter a search term, phrase, or URL. Double-tap Go, or select a search suggestion, then double-tap.
