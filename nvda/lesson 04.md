# Lesson 4

## NVDA on the Internet

NVDA works well with the Internet. You can use many web browsers, which
connect to websites to show their content. NVDA has two modes of
navigating the web: Browse mode and Focus mode. In Browse mode, NVDA
lets you read the website like a text document, with keys to quickly
find items on the page. In Focus mode, NVDA lets you fill out forms
and use web apps. In fact, when you press Tab, and hear the typewriter
sound when you come across the form to log into this site, you are put
into Focus mode in order to type your username and password, and taken
out of it when you reach the login button.

## Reading the Web

Navigating the Internet in Browse mode is much like navigating text
documents. In fact, much of the Internet, for now, is made up of
textual documents which link to other pages, have images,
tables, and other content in them, so you’ll be able to get through a
lot just by reading. Internet documents, called web pages, can even
host entire programs running on Internet servers, like Google Drive.

NVDA provides users a way to read web pages like a Notepad document,
or navigate controls like a regular program. You can use your arrow
keys to read line by line. You can read the entire document with
Insert + Down Arrow. You can move to the next link or control with the
Tab key, and activate it with the Enter key. You can find out what
page you’re on with **Insert + T**. However, there are quicker ways to
navigate the Internet, which you will learn about in the next section.

## Finding text

When you know what you’re looking for, finding text can make
navigating websites quick and easy. For example, if you know that,
after signing into the alassist.us site, you’re looking for your NVDA
Foundation lessons, you can search for “NVDA Foundation,” or just “NVDA” to
look for that link to press. If you do not find the right one on the
first try, press **Insert + F3**, and NVDA will look for the next
occurrence of that text. To find the previous occurrence, press
**Insert + Shift + F3**.

### Activity

Please read through the following activity, then perform it to find text on a web page:

- Press **Control + Home** to go to the top of the page.
- Press **Insert + Control + F** to open the Find dialog box.
- Type “activity” without the quotation marks.
- Press **Enter**. You will be taken to the Activity section.

## Finding objects

The web contains many types of items. There are headings, links,
lists, forms, check boxes, buttons, radio buttons, separators, images,
frames, edit fields, block quotes, and quite a few others.

The following keys by themselves jump to the next available item,
while adding the shift key causes them to jump to the previous item:

- h: heading
- l: list
- i: list item
- t: table
- k: link
- n: nonLinked text
- f: form field
- u: unvisited link
- v: visited link
- e: edit field
- b: button
- x: checkbox
- c: combo box
- r: radio button
- q: block quote
- s: separator
- m: frame
- g: graphic
- d: landmark
- o: embedded object (audio and video player, application, dialog, etc.)
- 1 to 6: headings at levels 1 to 6 respectively
- a: annotation (comment, editor revision, etc.)
- w: spelling error

### Activity

Please perform the following steps to quickly navigate to an object:

- Press **Shift + H** to move to the previous heading. When you’ve
  reached this spot again, move on to the next step.
- Press **Shift + L** to move to the previous list. Find this spot
  again by searching for text in this sentence.
- Press “K” to move to the next link.

## Listing objects

There may be times when you don’t need to find text on a page, and do
not know how to spell something, but know what type of object it is.
You can do this by listing objects. This allows you to press a letter,
which will navigate you to objects beginning with that letter, where
you can then Down Arrow through them to find what you’re looking for.

On the web, everything is an element. Paragraphs are elements, lists
are elements, both ordered lists and unordered ones, with list items
inside them. This is why the dialog used to find items is called the
“elements list.”

### Activity

Please complete the following steps to use the Elements List:

- Press **Insert + F7**. The Elements List will open.
- Use the **Down Arrow** and **Up Arrow** to move through the list of links.
- Use **Tab** and **Shift + Tab** to move through controls in this dialog box. Press **Escape**, and read through the next paragraph, then follow the instructions that follow.

  You’ll find an edit box to filter the items in the elements list, an
  “OK” button, a “Cancel” button, and a radio button group to change
  the elements of the list, such as links, headings, and other
  elements.

- Change the list of elements to “Headings”, and tab back to the list,
  making sure that headings are shown. When you find the “Activity”
  heading associated with this section of the lesson, press **Enter**
  to move to it. Practice this a few times, experimenting if you wish,
  for a short time, then continue to the next lesson.
