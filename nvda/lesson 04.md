Editing Text with NVDA
======================

Editing text mostly deals with Windows keyboard commands, so use the
knowledge you’ve gained from the *Windows Basics with Speech* course
along with the new information gained in this lesson. You’ll use
Windows commands for moving around and editing text, and NVDA commands
for reading some information. Learning to use any operating system to
the best of its strengths, along with the abilities of any screen
reader makes the user much more able to learn new applications, web
sites, and operating systems.

Reading a line
==============

While you write, you may wish to read the line you’re on. To do this,
press **Insert + Up Arrow**. NVDA will speak the line which the cursor
is on.

Activity
--------

Please complete the following steps to read a line:

- Open Notepad
- Type “This is a test.”, press **Enter**, then type “This is a second
  test.”.
- Press **Up Arrow**. NVDA will read the previous line.
- Press **Insert + Up Arrow**. NVDA will read that line again.
- Press **Down Arrow**, which moves you to the below line.
- Press **Insert + Up Arrow**, which will read that line again.
- Press **Control + End** to move to the end of the file.
- Press **Enter**, then type “This is a third test.”.
- Press **Insert + Up arrow**, which will read that line, without you
  needing to arrow to it. This may be used to help you remember what
  to write next.

Reading all of the document
===========================

NVDA can read an entire document, from the place where the cursor is,
to the end of the document. This is great for reading articles on the
Internet, books, and documents where you’d rather read the whole
document rather than reading line by line. If you’ve followed the
instructions given in lesson 1, you also use this command to read your
lessons.

Activity
--------

Please complete the following steps to read a document:

- Open Notepad, and write a few lines of text. You can write anything
  you like.
- After writing your document, press **Control + Home** to move to the
  beginning of the document.
- Turn on Keyboard Help mode
- Press **Insert + Down Arrow** to hear what the command does
- Turn off Keyboard Help mode
- Press **Insert + Down Arrow** to read your document
