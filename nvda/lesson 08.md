# Lesson 8

## Browsing the Internet

Using NVDA, you can easily browse Internet sites, like news websites, forums for
discussion of topics among other people, blogs to read people’s views on items
of interest, or audio and video sources, like radio and such. NVDA even works
with “web apps,” which are programs that run on the web, like Gmail, Google
Docs, and Microsoft Office Online.

Navigating the Internet with NVDA is a lot like reading a document. You use the
arrow keys to read line by line, or character by character. Use the **Up** and
**Down** arrow keys to navigate by line, and the **Left** and **Right** arrow
keys to navigate by character. You can also navigate by word, paragraph, and
page.

As you navigate an Internet “document,” called a web page, you will hear many
types of items described by what they are, or what function they perform. You
may hear “Heading 2 Lesson 8.” This means that the type of item is “heading 2,”
and it is called “Lesson 8.” While “Heading 2” may not sound familiar to you,
things like “button” and “list” will be more evident.

## Internet Item Types

As mentioned before, there are several types of items, called “elements” in
other places, that make up web pages. Below is a list of common types of items,
and what they are for.

<dl>
<dt>heading</dt>
<dd>A headline on a page, marking the beginning of important content.
Headings can range from level 1, most important, to level 6, least
important.</dd>
<dt>link</dt>
<dd>A word or phrase underlined in a different color than normal text,
which can be activated in order to moved to a different page, or a
different part of the current page.</dd>
<dt>list</dt>
<dd>A order or unordered vertical list of items. Ordered lists can be
ordered numerically or alphabetically. There are also definition
lists, consisting of terms followed by their definitions.</dd>
<dt>edit</dt>
<dd>An item which allows the user to type one line of information, like a username or email address</dd>
<dt>edit multiline</dt>
<dd>An edit control allowing more than one line to be entered, like a
forum post or comment.</dd>
<dt>Button</dt>
<dd>Items which can be activated to perform an action on a page, like
“search” buttons which search for items entered through an edit control,
or a “play” button which starts playback of media.</dd>
<dt>form</dt>
<dd>An item that contains other items that request user input, like
edit controls and buttons.</dd>
<dt>Check box</dt>
<dd>An item which can be activated or deactivated, turned on or
off.</dd>
<dt>radio button</dt>
<dd>Typically a group of items, where only one of them can be
chosen.</dd>
<dt>Combo Box</dt>
<dd>A box, which can be open or closed, that contains a list of items.
Only one item from the list can be chosen.</dd>
<dt>frame</dt>
<dd>A part of a page which is separate from the rest. These typically
contain advertisements.</dd>
<dt>landmark</dt>
<dd>A place on the page marked for a special purpose. Landmarks are often described, allowing you to know what they are for. A “Main”
landmark is the main part of a page. A “navigation” landmark is for
navigating the site. A “complementary” landmark usually contains notes
or sidebar material.</dd>

## moving to item types

While reading a web page, you might find that reading line by line, or even
paragraph by paragraph, becomes very slow. You’re at the top of a page, which
has lots of links to take you to different areas of the website, but you want to
get to an article or the content of the page. Using NVDA, you can move directly
to the part of a page you are looking for.

The following keys by themselves jump to the next available item, while adding
the shift key causes them to jump to the previous item:

- h: heading
- l: list
- i: list item
- t: table
- k: link
- n: nonLinked text
- f: form field
- u: unvisited link
- v: visited link
- e: edit field
- b: button
- x: checkbox
- c: combo box
- r: radio button
- q: block quote
- s: separator
- m: frame
- g: image
- d: landmark
- o: embedded object (audio and video player, application, dialog box, etc.)
- 1 to 6: headings at levels 1 to 6 respectively
- a: annotation (comment, editor revision, etc.)
- w: spelling error

## Finding text on a page

There may be times when you know some text you’d like to move to, but don’t know
quite where it is, or what item it is near, on a page. For this, there is a
*find* command. With this command, you can find a phrase, a word, or even part
of a word, anywhere on the page, no matter what type of item it is.

To open the Find function, you press **Insert + Control + f**. This opens the
find dialog box, where you can type some text to search for. After you’ve typed
your text, press **Enter**, and the page will be searched for that text. If it
is found, NVDA will move the cursor to that point on the page, but if it is not
found, NVDA will alert you of that fact.

The Elements List
=================

The *Elements list* is a function of NVDA which shows a list of all items on a
page of a certain type. Usually, it is used to show a list of all links, and is
useful if you want to have a list of items, without text or anything else. For
searching for links by text, it is better, and more quick, to use the Find
function.

To access the Elements list, press **Insert + F7**. This will open a list of
links. If you press **Shift + Tab**, you can arrow through a list of item types,
to change the type of item that is listed. Then, when you tab back to the list,
the new list of items is shown. When you’ve found the item you want to activate,
press **Enter** to move to it.
