Reviewing Text with NVDA
========================

Sometimes, using the arrow keys to read text isn’t what you want, or
can do, to review text in the program you’re in. Othertimes, you may
wish to review text on another line than the one you’re on, without
moving from the spot which your cursor is on.

NVDA provides a mechanism for reviewing the current control, web page,
document, or text area. This is called the Review Cursor, and is
different from the Windows text cursor which you use with the Arrow
keys.
