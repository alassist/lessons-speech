# Basic Navigation

To navigate Windows, you will use a few keyboard commands. These are
not screen reader commands, but are Windows concepts which enable a
blind person to use a computer, no matter which screen reader they
use. More in-depth Windows concepts are given in the *Windows Basics
with Speech* course, but the beginnings will be given here.

## The Tab key

The **Tab** key, located one key above the Caps Lock key, moves
between objects on the screen. For example, on a web page, it moves
between any non-text item on the page, including links, forms,
buttons, text entry boxes, the address bar, and so on. In programs, it
moves between any non-text controls in the program. We'll focus on
reading text in programs later on, and in a web browser in the
*Internet with Speech* course.

## Arrow keys

The **Arrow keys** navigate text. The Up and Down arrow keys navigate
up and down one line. The Left and Right arrow keys navigate left and
right one letter, or character, which includes letters, numbers,
symbols, and spaces. Combined with modifier keys, which will be
covered later, they move by different amounts, or select text, or
both.

## Modifier keys

The **Modifier Keys** are keys that do not generally act when pressed, but act when pressed with another key. To use a modifier to modify another key, hold down the modifier key, press the key to be modified, and release both keys. Do not hold down the modified key. The modifier keys are:

- Shift: Capitalizes a letter, or performs different actions when used     with non-character keys, like Tab.
- Alt: To the left and right of the space bar, used to open a     program's menu, or perform commands within that menu system.
- Windows: To the left of the left alt key, opens the start menu if     pressed, if it modifies a key that makes a key command, it does     system actions, like bringing up the menu to run commands and shut     down the computer.
- Control: To the left of the Windows key on most keyboards, to the     right of the context key, does program and text commands, like     moving by words and paragraphs, selecting all text, playing media,     and many other functions.
- Insert (Screen reader modifier): NVDA's modifier key. Press it with     another key to execute NVDA commands. the Insert key can be     combined with the control key to do even more commands. Hereafter,     it will be called the NVDA key, or the Insert key, in other     courses.

On laptop keyboard layouts, the screen reader modifier key is the capslock key, for NVDA's usage. If your laptop has a number pad, it may be easier to use NVDA in desktop layout, as you have a full desktop keyboard.

Writing Modifiers
-----------------

Modifier keys are used to modify the functions of other keys. To show that a key modifies another, this course, and many others, shows it by linking the two keys with the plus sign, and bolding the entire key press. For example, when the course says to press **Control + Alt + N**, it means to hold down the Control and Alt keys, press N, then release all keys. This is how keys are modified. If the course says to press **INSERT + N**, it means that you should hold down either the Insert or Capslock key, press N, then release both keys.

Help with the keyboard
======================

With NVDA, you can learn where keys are on the keyboard using *Keyboard Help Mode*. This mode allows you to press keys, just about any key, and hear its name or function. It also allows you to press NVDA commands to hear their function as well. This mode can be helpful if you get a new computer or keyboard of which you do not know the layout. It can also be helpful to try out commands, and to practice doing them. Note that if your keyboard has keys to put the computer into sleep mode or hibernation, or to shut the computer down, NVDA cannot intercept them, will not speak them, and they will perform their assigned task, so be careful with any keys on the top row of the keyboard.

To use Input help mode, press **Insert + 1**. This is a toggle key, which means that the key turns a function on and off. So, if you press it when it is off, Input Help mode turns on. If you press the key command when it is on, the mode is turned off.

Activity
--------

Complete the following actions:

-   Turn on Input Help mode.
-   Press the letter “S”.
-   Press the "Space" key.
-   Press the **Tab** key.
-   Press **Insert + Down Arrow**.
-   Turn off Keyboard Help mode.
-   Repeat these steps until you are comfortable with them, then     continue to the next section by pressing **Down Arrow** until you     hear "Heading level 1, what time is it?"

What time is it?
================

For your first NVDA command, besides the keyboard help command, you'll learn to have your computer tell the current time. This is useful for knowing how much time you have in class, so that you don't have to check a phone, watch, or note taker. To do this, press **INSERT + F12**. NVDA will speak the time, and show it in braille, if you have a braille display connected and in use. Note that the time in braille will only appear for a few seconds.

Quick tip
---------

If you press **INSERT + F12** twice quickly, you'll hear the current date.

Activity
--------

Complete the following actions:

-   Check the time using NVDA's key command.
-   Check the date using NVDA's key command.
-   Turn on keyboard help mode
-   Check the time while in Keyboard Help mode
-   Check the date while in Keyboard Help mode
-   Turn off Keyboard help mode
-   Repeat these steps until you feel comfortable with them, then move on to the next section: "Stopping and Pausing Speech."

Stopping and pausing speech
===========================

Sometimes, you may wish to stop NVDA's speech. Perhaps you must step away from the computer, answer a phone call, or stop the speech to begin navigating a page or document. NVDA has two facilities for doing this, stopping speech and pausing it.

To stop speech entirely, press Control. This forces NVDA to stop speaking and forget what it was about to say. This is good for stopping speech when you're ready to move somewhere else in text or in a program. With this method, you must begin reading the page again, or have NVDA repeat the item it is on in a program, to have NVDA speak what it was just speaking.

NVDA can also be paused. To do this, press Shift. NVDA will pause speaking, and wait to be resumed or have another command issued which will have it speak something different.

Activity
--------

Complete the following actions:

-   Have NVDA begin reading this section using **INSERT + Down Arrow**. Please read the rest of the instructions before following them.
-   Press **Shift** to pause speech, then **Shift** again to resume it.
-   Press **Control** to stop speech, then **INSERT + Down Arrow** to     begin reading again.
-   Turn on Keyboard Help mode
-   Press Control
-   Press Shift
-   Turn off Keyboard Help mode
-   Repeat these steps until you feel comfortable with them, then move on to Lesson 03.

Notice that when NVDA begins reading again, it begins at the place where it was stopped, not where it originally began reading.
