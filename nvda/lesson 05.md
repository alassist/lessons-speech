Reading the Web
===============

Navigating the Internet is much like navigating text documents. In
fact, much of the Internet, for now, is made up of textual documents
which link to other pages, have embedded images, tables, and other
content in them. Internet documents, called web pages, can even host
entire programs running on Internet servers, like Google Drive.

NVDA provides users a way to read web pages like a Notepad document,
and navigate controls like a regular program. You can use your arrow
keys to read line by line. You can read the entire document with
Insert + Down Arrow. You can move to the next link or control with the
Tab key, and activate it with the Enter key. You can find out what
page youâ€™re on with Insert + T. However, there are quicker ways to
navigate the Internet, which you will learn about in the next section.
