# Lesson 2: Creating and Opening sheets

Now that you know how to move around the Sheets interface, let’s work on creating new Google Sheets files, and opening them. There are many ways to do both of these tasks, but we’ll primarily focus on a few quick ways here.

## Google Drive

Before getting into opening and creating spreadsheets, let’s look at where they’re stored: Google Drive. Google Drive is like the hard drive on which all your Google files are stored. It is analogous to Windows’ File Explorer, the Mac’s Finder, and any file manager on Linux and other systems. So, the list of recently opened files you learned about in the previous lesson showed files from Google Drive. You can upload files to Drive from your computer as well, but that won’t be covered in this course.

To explore Google Drive, go to <https://drive.google.com>. There, you’ll find your list of files and folders.

## Create a Spreadsheet from Google Sheets

To create a spreadsheet from Google Sheets, go to “sheets.google.com” in your web browser, then Tab to the templates area discussed in Lesson 1. There, open any template, like the “Blank” template. Now, you’ll have a new Google Sheets spreadsheet.

## Create a Spreadsheet from Google Drive

To create a Spreadsheet from Google Drive, go to “drive.google.com”, and either press **Shift + S**, or press “C” and choose “Google sheet” from the list.

## Create a Sheet from the Chrome address bar

To create a Sheet from anywhere, just using your Chrome address bar, press **Control + L** to open the address or location bar, then type "sheets.new". This opens a blank Sheet immediately.

## Naming a Sheet

When you've created a Sheet, it is simply called "untitled". That quickly gets unwieldy when you have many untitled sheets, so let's start the good habbit of naming things. To start, create a new Sheet using any of the options listed above. It doesn't matter how you create the sheet, just that you find an option that works best, and quickest, for you. Once you're in the new sheet, which you can varify by moving around and hearing things like "A2, B2, C1" and such, we can rename the spreadhseet.

To rename a Spreadsheet, press **Alt + F**. This brings you to the Google Sheets menu bar, into the "file" menu. You can perform many functions here, and there is more than just the file menu, but we'll look at the other options later. From here, press "r". This opens the "rename" dialog box. Type "Sheets with Speech", and press **Enter**. You can use any name, but if you do so, from now on, use your chosen name instead of "Sheets with Speech."
