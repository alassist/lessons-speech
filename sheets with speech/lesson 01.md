# Introduction to Sheets

Google Sheets is a spreadsheet program from Google. It allows you to
work with numbers and text that is associated with numbers in
numerous ways. You can use it to keep a budget, keep up with
quantifiable items you have, or to produce charts and graphs.

Google Sheets is a “Web app” which runs in your web browser. Unlike
Microsoft Excel or LibreOffice Calc, Google Sheets lives entirely on
the web. The program is in the Cloud, and so are your files. This has
some benefits:

* Google Sheets is free. There are no costs to using it; all you need
  is a Google account.
* You don’t have to save your files, Sheets saves all edits, and allows
  you to revert to an older version of the file.
* None of your sheets take up space on your computer.
* All of your sheets can be read and edited on any of your devices.

There are, however, a few drawbacks as well:

* Sheets, as a web application, can be updated by Google at any time.
  This means faster updates and bug fixes, but can take some searching
  to find anything that has moved.
* Web apps are not yet as cohesive as desktop apps when using a screen
  reader. Expect some things to be spoken twice, or to have to enable
  screen reader support. This will improve over time.
* Many keyboard commands require you to hold down Control and Alt to
  perform them. This conflicts with the usual command to start NVDA.
  You'll need to either set the NVDA start command to something else,
  or use the Google Sheets menu for the functions that require that
  keyboard command's use.
* Your files are hosted on Google 's property, so expect Google to use
  any information you enter into Google Sheets. This information may
  be used to identify you, serve you personal ads, and may even be
  removed due to violating Google's terms of service.

## Getting started

Before you get started with Google Sheets, you'll need to have the
following programs:

* A screen reader: NVDA works best, but JAWS can be used.
* A web browser: Google Chrome, or Chrome-based browsers like the
  *newest* version of Microsoft Edge, or Firefox can be used. Internet
  Explorer should not be used due to being unsupported.
* Familiarity with using a screen reader on the Internet: It is
  advised that you've completed the Internet with Speech course, or
  that you can easily and comfortably navigate the Internet before
  continuing.

Being a web application (or program), Google Sheets relies on a web
browser. In this course, it doesn't matter which one you choose, just
that you are aware of how it works, which one you have, and the small
differences between the browsers. For example, Google Chrome and
Firefox use different commands for accessing the Google Sheets menu
bar. That will be discussed later, but it is important to understand
differences such as the example given here.

## Opening Google Sheets

Google Sheets is a web app. Therefore, to open Google Sheets, you’ll
use a web browser. Even though Google Sheets is a web app, an normal
web address is used to access it. To open Google Sheets, do the
following:

1. If you don’t already have one open, run a web browser.
2. Go to the address bar, if you aren’t already there.
3. Enter the address “sheets.google.com” without the surrounding
   quotes.
4. Press **Enter**.

## The Google Sheets interface

When Google Sheets opens, you’ll be placed into a list of your most
recently opened files. If this isn’t your experience, try pressing
Tab, or **Control + Alt + Z**. The **Control + Alt + Z** keyboard
command turns on screen reader support in Google Sheets.

## Navigating Google Sheets

Now that you’ve navigated to Google Sheets, we can navigate through
all of the controls within the main screen. This is similar to the
“home screen” of Microsoft Office, when the program is opened without
a document being open.

Starting from the focused item, there is the list of recently opened
items. This is a list that starts with the most recently opened item.
If you press **Down Arrow**, you’ll find the next item in reverse
chronological order. This list is grouped into “headings” of “today,”
“last seven days,” and so on. Your screen reader will let you know
when you arrive at the next group heading. You can continue to press
**Down Arrow** to reach more items.

If you press the **Tab** key, you’ll find the “More actions button.” This
button brings up actions you can perform on the current file; You can
remove it, or open it in a new tab. If you press **Tab** again, you’ll
find the “Main menu button.” This is inside a “banner,” so don’t be
alarmed if you hear the word “banner” spoken by your screen reader.
These are Landmarks, parts of a web page.

The “main menu” item is a “collapsed button”, which means that when
you press the button, it will open something else. In the case of the
“main menu” button, it opens a list. Within this list is:

* Docs: Opens Google Docs, used for writing documents.
* Sheets: Opens Sheets, which you’re already in, so there is no need
  to use this.
* Slides: Opens Google Slides, for creating and viewing presentations.
* Forms: Allows you to open Google Forms, to create forms.
* Settings: Allows you to open settings for Google Sheets.
* Help and Feedback: Allows you to read help documentation for Google
  Sheets, or leave feedback.
* Drive: Allows you to open Google Drive, where you can access all of
  your files saved to Google Drive.

After the main menu, there is a “Sheets” link, which just goes back to
the sheets page which you’re on now. After the link is a “Search bar”
edit field for searching for sheets, and a “search” button to submit
the search. You can also press **Enter** after typing your search
keywords.

After the search bar is a “Google apps” collapsed button. If you press
**Enter** on it, you’ll be taken to a list of links where you can
choose another app, like Gmail or Search, to go to. Once you find the
app you want, you can press **Enter** to go to it, or if you don’t
want to choose another app, press **Escape** to close the list.

after the “Google Apps” collapsed button is the “Google Account”
collapsed button. This button allows you to choose another Google
account to use Sheets with. This can be useful if you have more than
one Google account, with separate sheets stored within each account.

Next is the “Recently used” list box, which contains templates for
spreadsheets that you’ve used before. Passed that is the “template
gallery” button, which contains all templates, not just the most recently
used ones. Passed the gallery button is a “more actions” button which,
when expanded, allows you to “hide all templates,” if you don’t plan
on using any.

After the “more actions” button for dealing with templates is the
“owner Filter Options,” collapsed button. Inside this menu are options
to filter the “recently opened” Sheets list by Sheets “Owned by
anyone” or “owned by me.”

Next is a button that changes the “view” of the list of recently
opened Sheets. There are two views: list view and grid view. List view
shows the Sheets in a list, one on each line. In grid view, the Sheets
are in a grid, several per line. if the button says “grid view,” then
Sheets is in list view, and pressing the button will change this to
grid view. If the button says “list view,” then Sheets is in grid
view, and pressing the button will change this to list view.

Next is “Sort Options,” a button which allows you to control how files
are sorted. You can choose between “Last opened by me,” “Last Modified
by me,” “Last Modified,” and “Title.” By default, “Last opened by me,”
is selected.

Finally is the “open file picker” button. This allows you to open a
file from Google Drive, or upload a file from your computer to be
opened in Sheets. If you are familiar with Google Drive, you can
navigate this to find a file there. There is also a search box in this
dialog to find a file, filtered to only find Sheets.

After the “open file picker” button is the list of Sheets, again
sorted by most recently opened.. Now that you know the layout of the
Sheets “home screen,” the next lesson will cover creating a new Sheet
and opening existing Sheets.
