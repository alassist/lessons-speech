# Introduction to Sheets

Google Sheets is a spreadsheet program from Google. It allows you to
work with numbers, and text that is associated with numbers in numerous ways. You can use it to keep a budget, keep up with quantifiable items
you have, or to produce charts and graphs.

Google Sheets is a “Web app” which runs in your web browser. Unlike
Microsoft Excel or LibreOffice Calc, Google Sheets lives entirely on
the web. The program is in the Cloud, and so are your files. This has
some benefits:

- Google Sheets is free. There are no costs to using it; all you need
  is a Google account.
- You don’t have to save your files, Sheets saves all edits, and allows
  you to revert to an older version of the file.
- All of your sheets do not take up space on your computer.
- All of your sheets can be read and edited on all of your devices.

There are, however, a few drawbacks as well:

- Sheets, as a web application, can be updated by Google at any time.
  This means faster updates and bug fixes, but can take some searching
  to find anything that has moved.
- Web apps are not yet as cohesive as desktop apps when using a screen
  reader. Expect some things to be spoken twice, or to have to enable
  screen reader support. This will improve over time.
- Many keyboard commands require you to hold down Control and Alt to
  perform them. This conflicts with the usual command to start NVDA.
  You'll need to either set the NVDA start command to something else,
  or use the Google Sheets menu for the functions that require that
  keyboard command's use.
- Your files are hosted on Google 's property, so expect Google to use
  any information you enter into Google Sheets. This information may
  be used to identify you, serve you personal ads, and may even be
  removed due to violating Google's terms of service.

## Getting started

Before you get started with Google Sheets, you'll need to have the
following programs:

- A screen reader: NVDA works best, but JAWS can be used.
- A web browser: Google Chrome, or Chrome-based browsers like the
  *newest* version of Microsoft Edge, or Firefox can be used. Internet
  Explorer should not be used due to being unsupported.
- Familiarity with using a screen reader on the Internet: It is
  advised that you've completed the Internet with Speech course, or
  that you can easily and comfortably navigate the Internet before
  continuing.

Being a web application (or program), Google Sheets relies on a web
browser. In this course, it doesn't matter which one you choose, just
that you are aware of how it works, which one you have, and the small
differences between the browsers. For example, Google Chrome and
Firefox use different commands for accessing the Google Sheets menu
bar. That will be discussed later, but it is important to understand
differences such as the example given here.

## Opening Google Sheets

Google Sheets is a web app. Therefore, to open Google Sheets, you’ll
use a web browser. Even though Google Sheets is a web app, an normal
web address is used to access it. To open Google Sheets, do the
following:

1. If you don’t already have one open, run a web browser.
2. Go to the address bar, if you aren’t already there.
3. Enter the address “sheets.google.com” without the surrounding
   quotes.
4. Press **Enter**.

## The Google Sheets interface

When Google Sheets opens, you’ll be placed into a list of your most
recently opened files. If this isn’t your experience, try pressing
Tab, or **Control + Alt + Z**. The **Control + Alt + Z** keyboard
command turns on screen reader support in Google Sheets.

## Navigating Google Sheets

Now that you’ve navigated to Google Sheets, we can navigate through
all of the controls within the main screen. This is similar to the
“home screen” of Microsoft Office, when the program is opened without
a document being open.

Starting from the focused item, there is the list of recently opened
items. This is a list that starts with the most recently opened item.
If you press **Down Arrow**, you’ll find the next item in reverse
chronological order. This list is grouped into “headings” of “today,”
“last seven days,” and so on. Your screen reader will let you know
when you arrive at the next group heading. You can continue to press
**Down Arrow** to reach more items..

If you press the **Tab** key, you’ll find the “More actions button.” This
button brings up actions you can perform on the current file; You can
remove it, or open it in a new tab. If you press **Tab** again, you’ll
find the “Main menu button.” This is inside a “banner,” so don’t be
alarmed if you hear the word “banner” spoken by your screen reader.
These are Landmarks, parts of a web page.

The “main menu” item is a “collapsed button”, which means that when
you press the button, it will open something else. In the case of the
“main menu” button, it opens a list. Within this list is:

* Docs: Opens Google Docs, used for writing documents.
* Sheets: Opens Sheets, which you’re already in, so there is no need
  to use this.
* Slides: Opens Google Slides, for creating and viewing presentations.
