# Introduction to Sheets

Google Sheets is a spreadsheet program from Google. It allows you to
work with numbers, and text that is associated with numbers in numerous ways. You can use it to keep a budget, keep up with quantifiable items
you have, or to produce charts and graphs.

Google Sheets is a “Web app” which runs in your web browser. Unlike
Microsoft Excel or LibreOffice Calc, Google Sheets lives entirely on
the web. The program is in the Cloud, and so are your files. This has
some benefits:

- Google Sheets is free. There are no costs to using it; all you need
  is a Google account.
- You don’t have to save your files, Sheets saves all edits, and allows
  you to revert to an older version of the file.
- All of your sheets do not take up space on your computer.
- All of your sheets can be read and edited on all of your devices.

There are, however, a few drawbacks as well:

- Sheets, as a web application, can be updated by Google at any time.
  This means faster updates and bug fixes, but can take some searching
  to find anything that has moved.
- Web apps are not yet as cohesive as desktop apps when using a screen
  reader. Expect some things to be spoken twice, or to have to enable
  screen reader support. This will improve over time.
- Many keyboard commands require you to hold down Control and Alt to
  perform them. This conflicts with the usual command to start NVDA.
  You'll need to either set the NVDA start command to something else,
  or use the Google Sheets menu for the functions that require that
  keyboard command's use.
- Your files are hosted on Google 's property, so expect Google to use
  any information you enter into Google Sheets. This information may
  be used to identify you, serve you personal ads, and may even be
  removed due to violating Google's terms of service.

## Getting started

Before you get started with Google Docs, you'll need to have the
following programs:

- A screen reader: NVDA works best, but JAWS can be used.
- A web browser: Google Chrome, or Chrome-based browsers like the
  *newest* version of Microsoft Edge, or Firefox can be used. Internet
  Explorer should not be used due to being unsupported.
- Familiarity with using a screen reader on the Internet: It is
  advised that you've completed the Internet with Speech course, or
  that you can easily and comfortably navigate the Internet before
  continuing.

Being a web application (or program), Google Sheets relies on a web
browser. In this course, it doesn't matter which one you choose, just
that you are aware of how it works, which one you have, and the small
differences between the browsers. For example, Google Chrome and
Firefox use different commands for accessing the Google Sheets menu
bar. That will be discussed later, but it is important to understand
differences such as the example given here.
