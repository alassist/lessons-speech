# Sheets with Speech

Welcome to the Google Sheets with Speech course, In this course, you will learn how to use Google Sheets with a screen reader. This course is as screen reader agnostic as possible, meaning that you can use this course with JAWS, NVDA, VoiceOver, and ChromeVox, along with any other screen reader that works with advanced web applications like Google Sheets.

Although this course is updated as new features and changes are added to Google Sheets, you may find information, like keyboard commands or menu item placement, that does not work or needs updating. If you do, please contact your instructor. If your are confident in the use of your screen reader, you may search around for the correct answer yourself.
