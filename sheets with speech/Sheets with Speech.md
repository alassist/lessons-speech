# Sheets with Speech

Welcome to the Google Sheets with Speech course, In this course, you will learn how to use Google Sheets with a screen reader. This course is as screen reader agnostic as possible, meaning that you can use this course with JAWS, NVDA, VoiceOver, and ChromeVox, along with any other screen reader that works with advanced web applications like Google Sheets.

Although this course is updated as new features and changes are added to Google Sheets, you may find information, like keyboard commands or menu item placement, that does not work or needs updating. If you do, please contact your instructor. If your are confident in the use of your screen reader, you may search around for the correct answer yourself.

# Lesson 1: Introduction to Sheets

Google Sheets is a spreadsheet program from Google. It allows you to work with numbers, and text that is associated with numbers, in numerous ways. You can use it to keep a budget, keep up with quantifiable items you have, or produce charts and graphs.

Google Sheets is a “Web app” which runs in your web browser. Unlike Microsoft Excel or LibreOffice Calc, Google Sheets lives entirely on the web. The program is in the Cloud, and so are your files. This has some benefits:

* Google Sheets is free. There are no costs to using it; all you need is a Google account.
* You don’t have to save your files, Sheets saves all edits and allows you to revert to an older version of the file.
* None of your sheets take up space on your computer.
- All of your sheets can be read and edited on any of your devices.

There are, however, a few drawbacks as well:

* Sheets, as a web application, can be updated by Google at any time. This means faster updates and bug fixes but can take some searching to find anything that has moved.
* Web apps are not yet as cohesive as desktop apps when using a screen reader. Expect some things to be spoken twice or to have to enable screen reader support. This will improve over time.
* Many keyboard commands require you to hold down Control and Alt to perform them. This conflicts with the usual command to start NVDA. You'll need to either set the NVDA start command to something else, or use the Google Sheets menu for the functions that require that keyboard command's use.
* Your files are hosted on Google's property, so expect Google to use any information you enter into Google Sheets. This information may be used to identify you, serve personal ads to you, and may even be removed due to violating Google's terms of service.

## Getting started

Before you get started with Google Sheets, you'll need to have the following programs:

* A screen reader: NVDA works best, but JAWS can be used.
* A web browser: Google Chrome, or Chrome-based browsers like the _newest_ version of Microsoft Edge, or Firefox can be used. Internet Explorer should not be used due to being unsupported.
* Familiarity with using a screen reader on the Internet: It is advised that you've completed the Internet with Speech course, or that you can easily and comfortably navigate the Internet before continuing.

Being a web application (or program), Google Sheets relies on a web browser. In this course, it doesn't matter which one you choose, just that you are aware of how it works, which one you have, and the small differences between the browsers. For example, Google Chrome and Firefox use different commands for accessing the Google Sheets menu bar. That will be discussed later, but it is important to understand differences such as the example given here.

## Opening Google Sheets

Google Sheets is a web app. Therefore, to open Google Sheets, you’ll use a web browser. Even though Google Sheets is a web app, a normal web address is used to access it. To open Google Sheets, do the following:

1. If you don’t already have one open, run a web browser.
2. Go to the address bar, if you aren’t already there.
3. Enter the address “sheets.google.com” without the surrounding quotes.
4. Press **Enter**.

## The Google Sheets interface

When Google Sheets opens, you’ll be placed into a list of your most recently opened files. If this isn’t your experience, try pressing Tab, or **Control + Alt + Z**. The **Control + Alt + Z** keyboard command turns on screen reader support in Google Sheets.

## Navigating Google Sheets

Now that you’ve navigated to Google Sheets, we can navigate through all of the controls within the main screen. This is similar to the “home screen” of Microsoft Office, when the program is opened without a document being open.

Starting from the focused item, there is the list of recently opened items. This is a list that starts with the most recently opened item. If you press the **Down Arrow**, you’ll find the next item in reverse-chronological order. This list is grouped into “headings” of “today,” “last seven days,” and so on. Your screen reader will let you know when you arrive at the next group heading. You can continue to press **Down Arrow** to reach more items.

If you press the **Tab** key, you’ll find the “More actions button.” This button brings up actions you can perform on the current file; You can remove it, or open it in a new tab. If you press **Tab** again, you’ll find the “Main menu button.” This is inside a “banner,” so don’t be alarmed if you hear the word “banner” spoken by your screen reader. These are Landmarks, parts of a web page.

The “main menu” item is a “collapsed button”, which means that when you press the button, it will open something else. In the case of the “main menu” button, it opens a list. Within this list is:

* Docs: Opens Google Docs, used for writing documents.
* Sheets: Opens Sheets, which you’re already in, so there is no need to use this.
* Slides: Opens Google Slides, for creating and viewing presentations.
* Forms: Allows you to open Google Forms, to create forms.
* Settings: Allows you to open settings for Google Sheets.
* Help and Feedback: Allows you to read help documentation for Google Sheets, or leave feedback.
* Drive: Allows you to open Google Drive, where you can access all of your files saved to Google Drive.

After the main menu, there is a “Sheets” link, which just goes back to the sheets page which you’re on now. After the link is a “Search bar” edit field for searching for sheets, and a “search” button to submit the search. You can also press **Enter** after typing your search keywords.

After the search bar, you’ll find a “Google apps” collapsed button. If you press **Enter** on it, you’ll be taken to a list of links where you can choose another app, like Gmail or Search, to go to. Once you find the app you want, you can press **Enter** to go to it, or if you prefer not to choose another app, press **Escape** to close the list.

After the “Google Apps” collapsed button is the “Google Account” collapsed button. This button allows you to choose another Google account to use Sheets with. This can be useful if you have more than one Google account, with separate sheets stored within each account.

Next is the “Recently used” list box, which contains templates for spreadsheets that you’ve used before. Past that is the “template gallery” button, which contains all templates, not just the most recently used ones. Passed the gallery button is a “more actions” button which, when expanded, allows you to “hide all templates,” if you don’t plan on using any.

After the “more actions” button for dealing with templates is the “owner Filter Options,” collapsed button. Inside this menu are options to filter the “recently opened” Sheets list by Sheets “Owned by anyone” or “owned by me.”

Next is a button that changes the “view” of the list of recently opened Sheets. There are two views: list view and grid view. List view shows the Sheets in a list, one on each line. In grid view, the Sheets are in a grid, several per line. If the button says “grid view,” then Sheets is in list view, and pressing the button will change this to grid view. If the button says “list view,” then Sheets is in grid view, and pressing the button will change this to list view.

Next is “Sort Options,” a button which allows you to control how files are sorted. You can choose between “Last opened by me,” “Last Modified by me,” “Last Modified,” and “Title.” By default, “Last opened by me,” is selected.

Finally, is the “open file picker” button. This allows you to open a file from Google Drive, or upload a file from your computer to be opened in Sheets. If you are familiar with Google Drive, you can navigate this to find a file there. There is also a search box in this dialog to find a file, filtered to only find Sheets.

After the “open file picker” button is the list of Sheets, again sorted by most recently opened. Now that you know the layout of the Sheets “home screen,” the next lesson will cover creating a new Sheet and opening existing Sheets.

# Lesson 2: Creating and Opening sheets

Now that you know how to move around the Sheets interface, let’s work on creating new Google Sheets files, and opening them. There are many ways to do both tasks, but we’ll primarily focus on a few quick ways here.

## Google Drive

Before getting into opening and creating spreadsheets, let’s look at where they’re stored: Google Drive. Google Drive is like the hard drive on which all your Google files are stored. It is analogous to Windows’ File Explorer, the Mac’s Finder, and any file manager on Linux and other systems. So, the list of recently opened files you learned about in the previous lesson showed files from Google Drive. You can upload files to Drive from your computer as well, but that won’t be covered in this course.

To explore Google Drive, go to [https://drive.google.com](https://drive.google.com). There, you’ll find your list of files and folders.

## Create a Spreadsheet from Google Sheets

To create a spreadsheet from Google Sheets, go to “sheets.google.com” in your web browser, then Tab to the templates area discussed in Lesson 1. There, open any template, like the “Blank” template. Now, you’ll have a new Google Sheets spreadsheet.

## Create a Spreadsheet from Google Drive

To create a Spreadsheet from Google Drive, go to “drive.google.com”, and either press **Shift + S**, or press “C” and choose “Google sheet” from the list.

## Create a Sheet from the Chrome address bar

To create a Sheet from anywhere, just using your Chrome address bar, press **Control + L** to open the address or location bar, then type "sheets.new". This opens a blank Sheet immediately.

## Naming a Sheet

When you've created a Sheet, it is simply called "untitled". That quickly gets unwieldy when you have many untitled sheets, so let's start the good habit of naming things. To start, create a new Sheet using any of the options listed above. It doesn't matter how you create the sheet, just that you find an option that works best, and quickest, for you. Once you're in the new sheet, which you can verify by moving around and hearing things like "A2, B2, C1" and such, we can rename the spreadsheet.

To rename a Spreadsheet, press **Alt + F**. This brings you to the Google Sheets menu bar, into the "file" menu. You can perform many functions here, and there is more than just the file menu, but we'll look at the other options later. From here, press "r". This opens the "rename" dialog box. Type "Sheets with Speech", and press **Enter**. You can use any name, but if you do so, from now on, use your chosen name instead of "Sheets with Speech."

Move on to the next lesson to find out about the Sheets interface with a spreadsheet open.

# Lesson 3: The Sheets Interface

Google Sheets, being a web application, has different interface items than a normal desktop program. This makes it slightly different to learn and use, and slightly different for each browser. In this lesson, you’ll learn about the Menu bar, the Toolbar, and the top-level buttons.

## The Menu bar

The Menu bar is where you’ll find all that you can do with your spreadsheet. It contains functions pertaining to the file itself, editing, inserting objects, formatting, extra tools, like spell check, accessibility options, and other such menus. Opening the menu is different for different browsers. Ways to open the Menu bar are listed below:

* On Windows with Firefox, press **Alt + Shift + F**.
* On Windows with Chrome, press **Alt + F**.
* In ChromeOS, press **Alt + F**.
* On macOS, first press **Control + Option + Tab** to ignore the following keys from VoiceOver and send it directly to the browser, then **Control + Option + F**.

From there, you can press the arrow keys to move throughout the menus. Using the Left and Right arrow moves from menu to menu. For example, when you press the **Right Arrow** from the File menu, you’ll move to the Edit menu. If you press the **Left Arrow** from the edit menu, you’ll move to the File menu. Using the Up and Down arrow keys moves within a menu. If you press the **Down Arrow** from the File menu, you’ll find options like “new” and “share.” To activate any item in the menus, like “Copy” in the Edit menu, press **Enter**.

Press the **Down Arrow** from the File menu until you come to the “Download” option. This option is a submenu, which is a menu inside another menu. To open this menu, press the **Right Arrow**. To back out of a submenu, press **Left Arrow**. You can activate anything in submenus the same as in other menus, with the **Enter** key.

## The Toolbar

The Toolbar is where you can access formatting tools. You can also access these through the Menu bar, but the Toolbar may be easier to access or use for you.

To access the Toolbar, open the Menu bar, then press **Tab**. You’ll find functions like “Open version history”, “Undo”, and “Hide the menus.” When you find an item you want to use, press **Enter** on it. To move away from the Toolbar, press **Escape**.

## The Top Buttons

The Top Buttons contain options for overviewing the document. Here, you’ll find options to share the document, see comments, and see version history for the document. To find the Top Buttons, open the Menu bar, and then press **Shift + Tab**.

## Activity: Configure Accessibility

Using the knowledge gained in this lesson, let’s make sure accessibility is configured in Google Sheets before we continue. There are two parts to configuring accessibility in Sheets. First, we must enable Screen reader mode. Next, we’ll enable Braille support to enhance screen reader mode, to make it much more like other programs. Follow the steps below to do this.

1. Open the Menu bar by using the keyboard commands for your operating system and web browser.
2. Press the **Left Arrow** until you reach the Tools menu.
3. Press **Up Arrow** until you find Accessibility Settings, and press **Enter**.
4. You’ll drive at the “Accessibility Settings” dialog. Press **Tab**, and you’ll find a checkbox to enable screen reader support. Check it if it is not checked, and leave it alone if it is.
5. Press **Tab** again, and you’ll find a checkbox that says “Turn on Braille support.” Check that if it’s not checked, or leave it alone if it is.
6. Tab twice to the “Ok” button and press **Enter**.

Now, you have Sheets, and all other Google Suite programs, fully accessible, and can move on to the next lesson.


# Lesson 4: Moving around a Spreadsheet

Cells are containers in a sheet which can hold numbers and text. They are similar to spaces on a chessboard where Chess pieces go. Since there are many cells in a Sheet, they are referenced by their row and column information.

Google Sheets is laid out in columns and rows. Columns are the cells that go down the sheet vertically. Rows are cells that go from left to right. Columns are labeled with letters, like A, B, and C, while rows are labeled with numbers, like 1, 2, and 3. So, A1 is column one, row one. B1 is column two, row 1. The column and row labels used together, like A1, is called the cell coordinates. You can use the cell coordinates to refer to a cell in many ways.

To move around the sheet from one item to the next, you use the arrow keys. If you move to the right, using **Right Arrow**, you'll move one column to the right. If you press **Left Arrow**, you'll move one column to the left. Picture this as feeling the top of the column as you move, so that as you move to the right, you feel another column of data. To move one row down, use the **Down Arrow**. To move one row up, use **Up Arrow**. This is similar to feeling down and finding a horizontal line, another row.

## Using The Go-to dialog box

You can use the Go-to dialog box to easily find a cell that is not near where you currently are. For example, let's say that you're at cell A1, and you need to go to cell G40. You can't quickly get there with arrow keys alone.

To use the Go-to dialog box, press **Control + J**, type the cell reference, and press **Enter**. When you open the Go-to dialog box, you'll be placed in the edit field where you can type the cell reference. So, if you want to go to cell G40, just type "G40" without the quotes, and press **Enter**. You are taken to that cell.
