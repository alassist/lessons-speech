# Lesson 03: Moving around a sheet

Using the knowledge gained in Lesson 2, you can now open an existing Sheet, or
create a new one. Create a new sheet, so you can learn to move around the sheet.

## Cells

Cells are containers in a sheet which can hold numbers and text. They are
similar to spaces on a Chess board where Chess pieces go. Since there are many
cells in a Sheet, they are referenced by their row and column information.

Google Sheets is layed out in columns and rows. Columns are the cells that go
down the sheet verticly. Rows are cells that go from left to right. Columns are
labeled with letters, like A, B, and C. Rows are labeled with numbers, like 1,
2, and 3. So, A1 is column one, row one. B1 is column two, row 1. The column and
row labels used together, like A1, is called the cell coordinates. You can use
the cell coordinates to refer to a cell in many ways.

To move around the sheet from one item to the next, you use the arrow
keys. If you move to the right, using **Right Arrow**, you'll move one column to
the right. If you press **Left Arrow**, you'll move one column to the left.
Picture this as feeling the top of the column as you move, so that as you move
to the right, you feel another column of data. To move one row down, use the
**Down Arrow**. To move one row up, use **Up Arrow**. This is similar to feeling
down and finding a horizontal line, another row.
