# Lesson 03: Moving around a sheet

Using the knowledge gained in Lesson 2, you can now open an existing Sheet, or
create a new one. Create a new sheet, so you can learn to move around the sheet.

## Cells

Cells are containers in a sheet which can hold numbers and text. They are
similar to spaces on a Chess board where Chess pieces go. Since there are many
cells in a Sheet, they are referenced by their row and column information.
