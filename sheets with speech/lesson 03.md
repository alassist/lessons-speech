# Lesson 03: Moving around a sheet

Using the knowledge gained in Lesson 2, you can now open an existing Sheet, or create a new one. Create a new sheet, so you can learn to move around the sheet.

## Cells

Cells are containers in a sheet which can hold numbers and text. They are similar to spaces on a Chess board where Chess pieces go. Since there are many cells in a Sheet, they are referenced by their row and column information.

Google Sheets is layed out in columns and rows. Columns are the cells that go down the sheet verticly. Rows are cells that go from left to right. Columns are labeled with letters, like A, B, and C. Rows are labeled with numbers, like 1, 2, and 3. So, A1 is column one, row one. B1 is column two, row 1. The column and row labels used together, like A1, is called the cell coordinates. You can use the cell coordinates to refer to a cell in many ways.

To move around the sheet from one item to the next, you use the arrow keys. If you move to the right, using **Right Arrow**, you'll move one column to the right. If you press **Left Arrow**, you'll move one column to the left. Picture this as feeling the top of the column as you move, so that as you move to the right, you feel another column of data. To move one row down, use the **Down Arrow**. To move one row up, use **Up Arrow**. This is similar to feeling down and finding a horizontal line, another row.

## Using The Go-to dialog box

You can use the Go-to dialog box to easily find a cell that is not near where you currently are. For example, let's say that you're at cell A1, and you need to go to cell G40. You can't quickly get there with arrow keys alone.

To use the Go-to dialog box, press **Alt + Slash (/)**, then type "go" without the quotes, press **Enter**, type the cell reference, and press **Enter** again. Typing "Control + Slash" opens an edit field in which you can type a command to perform. Since the "Go to" command isn't bound to a keyboard command, you'll need to use that to activate the Go to function. You'll be placed in the edit field of a dialog box where you can type the cell reference. So, if you want to go to cell G40, just type "G40" without the quotes, and press **Enter**. You are taken to that cell.
