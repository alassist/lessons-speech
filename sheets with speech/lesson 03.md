# Lesson 3: The Sheets Interface

Google Sheets, being a web application, has different interface items than a normal desktop program. This makes it slightly different to learn and use, and slightly different for each browser. In this lesson, you’ll learn about the Menu bar, the Toolbar, and the top-level buttons.

## The Menu bar

The Menu bar is where you’ll find all that you can do with your spreadsheet. It contains functions pertaining to the file itself, editing, inserting objects, formatting, extra tools, like spell check, accessibility options, and other such menus. Opening the menu is different for different browsers. Ways to open the Menu bar are listed below:

- On Windows with Firefox, press **Alt + Shift + F**.
- On Windows with Chrome, press **Alt + F**.
- In ChromeOS, press **Alt + F**.
- On macOS, first press **Control + Option + Tab** to ignore the following keys from VoiceOver and send it directly to the browser, then **Control + Option + F**.

From there, you can press the arrow keys to move throughout the menus. Using the Left and Right arrow moves from menu to menu. For example, when you press the **Right Arrow** from the File menu, you’ll move to the Edit menu. If you press the **Left Arrow** from the edit menu, you’ll move to the File menu. Using the Up and Down arrow keys moves within a menu. If you press the **Down Arrow** from the File menu, you’ll find options like “new” and “share.” To activate any item in the menus, like “Copy” in the Edit menu, press **Enter**.

Press the **Down Arrow** from the File menu until you come to the “Download” option. This option is a submenu, which is a menu inside another menu. To open this menu, press the **Right Arrow**. To back out of a submenu, press **Left Arrow**. You can activate anything in submenus the same as in other menus, with the **Enter** key.

## The Toolbar

The Toolbar is where you can access formatting tools. You can also access these through the Menu bar, but the Toolbar may be easier to access or use for you.

To access the Toolbar, open the Menu bar, then press **Tab**. You’ll find functions like “Open version history”, “Undo”, and “Hide the menus.” When you find an item you want to use, press **Enter** on it. To move away from the Toolbar, press **Escape**.

## The Top Buttons

The Top Buttons contain options for overviewing the document. Here, you’ll find options to share the document, see comments, and see version history for the document. To find the Top Buttons, open the Menu bar, and then press **Shift + Tab**.

## Activity: Configure Accessibility

Using the knowledge gained in this lesson, let’s make sure accessibility is configured in Google Sheets before we continue. There are two parts to configuring accessibility in Sheets. First, we must enable Screen reader mode. Next, we’ll enable Braille support to enhance screen reader mode, to make it much more like other programs. Follow the steps below to do this.

1. Open the Menu bar by using the keyboard commands for your operating system and web browser.
2. Press the **Left Arrow** until you reach the Tools menu.
3. Press **Up Arrow** until you find Accessibility Settings, and press **Enter**.
4. You’ll drive at the “Accessibility Settings” dialog. Press **Tab**, and you’ll find a checkbox to enable screen reader support. Check it if it is not checked, and leave it alone if it is.
5. Press **Tab** again, and you’ll find a checkbox that says “Turn on Braille support.” Check that if it’s not checked, or leave it alone if it is.
6. Tab twice to the “Ok” button and press **Enter**.

Now, you have Sheets, and all other Google Suite programs, fully accessible, and can move on to the next lesson.

# Lesson 4: Moving around a Spreadsheet

Cells are containers in a sheet which can hold numbers and text. They are similar to spaces on a chessboard where Chess pieces go. Since there are many cells in a Sheet, they are referenced by their row and column information.

Google Sheets is laid out in columns and rows. Columns are the cells that go down the sheet vertically. Rows are cells that go from left to right. Columns are labeled with letters, like A, B, and C, while rows are labeled with numbers, like 1, 2, and 3. So, A1 is column one, row one. B1 is column two, row 1. The column and row labels used together, like A1, is called the cell coordinates. You can use the cell coordinates to refer to a cell in many ways.

To move around the sheet from one item to the next, you use the arrow keys. If you move to the right, using **Right Arrow**, you'll move one column to the right. If you press **Left Arrow**, you'll move one column to the left. Picture this as feeling the top of the column as you move, so that as you move to the right, you feel another column of data. To move one row down, use the **Down Arrow**. To move one row up, use **Up Arrow**. This is similar to feeling down and finding a horizontal line, another row.

## Using The Go-to dialog box

You can use the Go-to dialog box to easily find a cell that is not near where you currently are. For example, let's say that you're at cell A1, and you need to go to cell G40. You can't quickly get there with arrow keys alone.

To use the Go-to dialog box, press **Control + J**, type the cell reference, and press **Enter**. When you open the Go-to dialog box, you'll be placed in the edit field where you can type the cell reference. So, if you want to go to cell G40, just type "G40" without the quotes, and press **Enter**. You are taken to that cell.
