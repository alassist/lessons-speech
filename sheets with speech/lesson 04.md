# Lesson 4: the Menu bar

Google Sheets has a ton of functions and options. These are in the menu bar. In
this lesson, we'll review how to get to the menu bar, and what all is in each
menu. As Google Sheets as an ever-changing system, the menus may change with it.
We'll try to keep this up-to-date, but your experience may vary.

## Finding the Menu bar

To open the Menu bar, do the following:

- On Windows, press **Alt + F** if on Chrome, or **Alt + Shift + F** if on other
  browsers.
- On Mac, press **VO + Tab** to pass the next key command through VoiceOver,
  then do **Control + Option + F**.
- On ChromeOS, press **Alt + F**.

Now, you'll be on the File menu. Here, you can press **Up arrow** or **Down
arrow** to move into that menu and explore what's in it, or use **Left arrow**
and **Right arrow** to move to the other menus, like Edit and View. Let's start
by going across, with **Right arrow**, the menus.

### File menu

The File menu contains things to do with your file, not so much the Sheets
functions. From here, you can create a new file in Docs, Sheets, Slides and
more. You can also open another file, rename the file, make a copy of the file,
share the file, print the file, import a file, download the file, make the file
available offline, publish the spreadsheet to the web, and view Sheets settings.

### The Edit menu

The Edit menu contains options for editing the sheet. These include formatting
and ways to copy, cut, and paste cells. You can undo changes, or redo them. In
adition to copying, cutting, and pasting, you can "paste special" which allows
you to paste only values of a cell, and more. You can find and replace, delete
values, delete the current row or column, delete cells and shift in different
directions, o clear notes.

### The View menu

The View menu may not have many useful actions for speech users, but we'll go
over what it contains, just in case you're working with a sighted person, or
presenting to a sighted audience. The view menu contains options to freeze
cells, show or hide grid lines, protect ranges of cells, show or hide the
formula bar, show or hide formulas, zoom in or out of the spreadsheet, and put
the spreadsheet into fullscreen mode.

### The Insert menu

In the Insert menu, you can insert cells, charts, and media. You can insert
rows above and below, and columns left and right. You can insert cells and
have the others shift in the other direction. You can also insert charts, images,
drawings, forms, functions, links, checkboxes, comments, and new sheets.
