# Lesson 4: the Menu bar

Google Sheets has a ton of functions and options. These are in the menu bar. In
this lesson, we'll review how to get to the menu bar, and what all is in each
menu. As Google Sheets as an ever-changing system, the menus may change with it.
We'll try to keep this up-to-date, but your experience may vary.

## Finding the Menu bar

To open the Menu bar, do the following:

- On Windows, press **Alt + F** if on Chrome, or **Alt + Shift + F** if on other
  browsers.
- On Mac, press **VO + Tab** to pass the next key command through VoiceOver,
  then do **Control + Option + F**.
- On ChromeOS, press **Alt + F**.

Now, you'll be on the File menu. Here, you can press **Up arrow** or **Down
arrow** to move into that menu and explore what's in it, or use **Left arrow**
and **Right arrow** to move to the other menus, like Edit and View. Let's start
by going across, with **Right arrow**, the menus.

### File menu

The File menu contains things to do with your file, not so much the Sheets
functions. From here, you can create a new file in Docs, Sheets, Slides and
more. You can also open another file, rename the file, make a copy of the file,
share the file, print the file, import a file, download the file, make the file
available offline, publish the spreadhseet to the web, and view Sheets settings.
