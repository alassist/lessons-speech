Creating a class

Press **Enter** on “Create Class.” You'll be placed into a dialog box, on the “Class Name” edit field. This field requires input. Type the name of the class, and press **Tab**.

Next, you'll be placed into the “section” edit field. Type the section, which is for entering a short description, grade level, or class time. When done, press **Tab**.

Now, you'll be in the “subject” edit field. This field can be typed into, but you can also type some text, then press **Down Arrow** to open a list of completions. Enter the subject, and press **Tab**.

Now, you'll be in the “room” edit field. If your class takes place in a particular room, type that here. When done, press **Tab** again.

Now, with all needed fields filled out, press **Tab** until you find the “Create” button. Press **Enter** on that, and your class will be created.

Your class page
===============

Let's assume your class is called “test”. Let's explore the page of your class.

To open your class page, either use the class' name in the class room main menu button at the top, or find it in the list of classes. Once open, we'll start from the top.

<dl>
<dt>Classroom Main Menu</dt>
<dd>The "hub" of Google Classroom, where you can get to all of your
classes, as well as the calendar and to do Google Apps.</dd>
<dt>heading level 1 test class</dt>
<dd>the first heading on the page, containing the name of your class.</dd>
<dt>Stream</dt>
<dd>This is where you can post things to your classes. This doesn't have
to be assignments, but could be text resources supplemental to the
class.</dd>
<dt>Class work</dt>
<dd>Assignments, quizzes, and material for the class.</dd>
<dt>People</dt>
<dd>A place to manage, and add, other teachers and students to the class</dd>
<dt>Grades</dt>
<dd>A place to see and manage grades.</dd>
<dt>Class Settings</dt>
<dd>A place to manage the name, description, category, and other

</dl>

When moving to another part of the class, from the stream to the class work, for example, you are placed on the main part of the page that is usually interacted with. On the stream page, it is the sharing section. On the class work page, it is the "create" button.

Adding people
=============

To add people to the classroom, choose the "people" link in your class. You will then be on the page where you can invite people. You can invite either teachers or students.

To invite teachers, press the "Invite Teachers" button. Enter a name or email address. If you type a name, or part of an email address, you can press **Tab** to move through a list of suggestions. To add a person in that list, press **Space Bar** to check that suggestion radio button. When done, press the "invite" button. Note that you can invite more than one person at a time.

To invite students, use the "invite students" button. Type the name or email address of students. If you type the name, or partial email address, of a student, you can press **Tab** to see a list of suggestions. To accept a suggestion, press **Space Bar** to check the suggestion radio button. When done, press the "invite" button. Note that you can invite more than one person at a time.

Creating work
=============

To create work for your class, use the "Classwork" link. You'll be placed on the "create" button. Press **Enter** on this button. You'll be presented with the following list:

<dl>
<dt>Assignment</dt>
<dd>A simple assignment.</dd>

</dl>

For this course, we'll create an assignment. Press **Enter** on “assignment,” and you'll be placed into the “title” edit field. Type the title of the assignment, and press **Tab**.

Now, you'll be placed into the “instructions” edit field, which is optional. Type the instructions, and press **Tab**. You'll be placed onto the “add” button, which brings up a menu of “Google Drive,” “Link”, “file,” and “Youtube”. If you want to choose one, press **Enter** on the button, choose one with the **Arrow keys**, and press **Enter**.

Press **Tab** to move to the next item. You'll be on the “create” button, which contains “Docs,” “Slides,” “Sheets,” “Drawings,” and “forms.” If you want to choose one of these, press **Enter**, use the arrow keys to find the option you want, and press **Enter** to begin creation.

Tab again, and you can choose which class you post the assignment to. If you press **Tab** once more, you can choose to post this to one particular student. It is set to post to all students by default.

Tab again, and you'll arrive at the “Maximum points” area. It is set at100. You can change this if you need to. After that is the control to choose a due date. If you press **Enter** on this, you can add a due date.

Next, you'll find the topics list. If you've not created one yet, you can press **Down arrow** and **Enter** to create one, or you can leave it as “No topic.” Next is the originality reports check box. If you turn this on, Google will check your students' work for plagiarism. After this, there is a link to learn more about originality reports, one to close the dialog box, and one to assign the work.
