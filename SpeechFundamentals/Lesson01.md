# Lesson 1: Getting Started with Screen Readers

In today’s world, technology has become an essential tool of daily life.
It gives us access to a wealth of information, communication, and
productivity tools. However, for people with visual impairments, taking
advantage of all the tools that technology has for us can be a daunting
task without the proper tools and training.

This is where screen readers come into play. Screen readers are computer
software that is designed to assist visually impaired individuals in
