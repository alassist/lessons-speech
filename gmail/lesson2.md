Once you have a Gmail account, go
to [gmail.com](https://mail.google.com/) to sign in to the standard
view of Gmail in any supported browser. You'll be taken to one of two
pages:

- The sign-in page, where you can enter your email username or select
  it from a list, then enter your password. If the page lists an email
  address, but you need to sign in to a different account than the one
  listed, select Manage accounts on this device.
- If you arrive at a page describing Gmail instead of the sign-in
  page, select the Sign in link to go to the sign-in page.
