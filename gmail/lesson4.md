# Lesson 4

Along with your screen reader navigation keystrokes, Gmail keyboard
shortcuts make it easier to navigate and take actions in Gmail.

Some keyboard shortcuts are enabled by default, and you can turn on the
remaining shortcuts by following the steps below:

1.  Navigate to the Settings button in the Gmail action bar, then press
    **Enter**.
2.  Navigate down the Settings menu to Settings, then press **Enter**.
3.  Move down the page, using Tab, to the "Keyboard shortcuts" option.
4.  Select "Keyboard shortcuts on."
5.  Navigate to the Save changes link, then press **Enter**.

<p><b>Note</b>: If you're using NVDA, you need to be in focus mode to use
Gmail keyboard shortcuts. If you're using JAWS, the virtual cursor must
be off. If you're using ChromeVox, no changes are necessary.</p>

If you ever forget a key combination, you can open a list of keyboard
shortcuts in Gmail by pressing the question mark (?). Along with a list
of shortcuts, the dialog contains a link to [view all Gmail shortcuts in
the Help Center](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/6594). To close
the dialog, press Escape.
