# Lesson 1

Gmail is an email service, and has its own email viewer (called a
client) also called Gmail. Gmail also has chat features, and can allow you
to start new meetings using Google Meet, right from Gmail. This course
will primarily overview Gmail's Email functions. When we use the word
"Gmail" in this course, we'll usually mean the client, not the service.

Gmail has historically had a "Basic HTML" view, which was simpler, but
took more time to navigate. Now, "Standard view" has surpassed the
basic view in all features and accessibility. Gmail's basic view could
be removed at any time, so if you currently use it, it's best to try
the standard view.

Gmail standard view includes all Gmail features and is the default view for [supported
browsers](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/6557).

We recommend the following screen readers for Gmail standard view:

| Operating system  | Screen reader | Browser       |
| ----------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Microsoft Windows | NVDA          | Google Chrome |
| MacOS (Mac)       | VoiceOver     | Google Chrome |
| Chrome OS         | ChromeVox     | Google Chrome |

For unsupported browsers, Gmail also provides a basic HTML view that
includes fewer features. Learn more about [standard view compared to
basic HTML view](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/15049), or [how
to use basic HTML view with a screen
reader](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/146375).
