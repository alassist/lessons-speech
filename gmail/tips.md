# Tips

Welcome to Gmail standard view! Here are some tips for using Gmail with
a screen reader:

-   The page includes these parts: Gmail action bar, Google bar, Compose
    button, Navigation list, Main section (where you view or read your
    email), Hangouts or chat, and Footer.
-   Gmail uses ARIA labels and headings to allow for easy screen reader
    navigation. You can navigate through the application using tabs or
    your standard screen reader keystrokes.
-   Gmail keyboard shortcuts allow you to perform certain actions
    quickly. For example, to send a message that you've finished
    composing, press **Control + Enter** (Windows, Chrome OS) or
    **Command + Enter** (Mac). For full list of shortcuts, press the
    question mark key (?). If you're using a screen reader with
    different modes, such as NVDA or JAWS, you'll need to be in focus
    mode (for NVDA) or turn off the virtual cursor (for JAWS) in order
    to use Gmail keyboard shortcuts.
-   Use the right and left arrow keys to move back and forth between the
    navigation list and the main content area of the page. For the
    navigation list, the ARIA landmark is "Navigation," and the heading
    is "Labels." For the main content area of the page, the ARIA
    landmark is "Main," and the heading is either "Conversations" or the
    subject line of the open conversation.

As you use Gmail, you can navigate to this help page at any time using
one of the options below:

-   Navigate to the hidden link for accessibility documentation near the
    top of the application: "Using Gmail with screen readers." When you
    open the link, this text opens in a new window.
-   Open the Settings menu and select Help. Browse the list of topics,
    or enter a search term and press Enter. Press Tab to navigate
    through the dialog, then press Enter to open a help article. The
    help documentation opens in a dialog where you can read or navigate
    to other topics. To dismiss the dialog and return to the main Gmail
    page, press Escape.
