# Lesson 7

If you want to find an email, it can be difficult to browse through hundreds of
old messages or click through multiple labels. Instead of browsing, try using
Gmail search:

1. Move to the Search Gmail edit box in the Gmail action bar, or press
   / (slash) if using Gmail keyboard commands.
2. Type your search terms, then press Enter.
3. The list of conversations is now your search results. Your focus is
   on the first conversation in the list.
4. To exit your search results and return to your inbox, press the left
   arrow to move to the navigation list, and select Inbox, or press G then I.

## When you search in Gmail

- Gmail searches the messages in the All Mail label, which includes
  messages that you've sent or received but haven't deleted. The Spam
  and Trash folders aren't searched.
- Searches aren't case sensitive.
- The search terms are matched against words in the Subject, To, and
  From fields, and in the message body. Gmail also tries to search
  attachments.

For more advanced searches, you can either use search operators in your
search terms, or you can use a form for entering advanced search
options. Both of these search methods are described in the following two
sections.

## Search operators

By default, your search terms are matched against the words in every
part of the message and sometimes in attachments. If you like, you can
specify a single part of the message and other attributes by using a
search operator. For example, you can specify whether you want to search
through messages that have been read, that are in a specific folder,
etc. Here are some examples of searches using search operators:

| Sample search              | Search results                                                                      |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| is:unread                  | All unread messages.                                                                |
| from:david                 | Messages with "David" in the sender field.                                          |
| to:david                   | Messages with "David" in the recipient field.                                       |
| from:pluto@disney.com      | Messages with the email address <pluto@disney.com> in the sender field.               |
| from:david subject:concert | Messages with "David" in the sender field and "concert" in the subject field.       |
| rock OR concert            | Messages that contain either "rock" or "concert." Note that OR must be capitalized. |
| "rock concert with David"  | Messages that contain the exact phrase "rock concert with David."                   |

You can use parentheses to group words in a search. Here are some
examples:

| Sample search                          | Search results                                                                                                                                  |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| subject:(rock concert)                 | Messages in which the subject contains both rock and concert.                                                                                   |
| subject:"rock concert"                 | Messages in which the subject contains the exact phrase "rock concert."                                                                         |
| (rock concert) OR bananas              | Messages that either contain the words "rock" and "concert," or contain the word "bananas."                                                     |
| from:((mickey mouse) OR (donald duck)) | Messages in which the from field either contains "mickey" and "mouse," or contains "donald" and "duck." Both sets of parentheses are necessary. |

### Advanced search options

1. You can use advanced search options in addition to search operators.
    To use advanced search options follow these steps:
2. Navigate to the Advanced search options button in the Gmail action
    bar, then press Enter.

- A form opens where you can enter your search criteria. Press Tab to
  navigate around the form and enter one or more of the following
  criteria:
- Search "All Mail," or select a different label in the list box.
- Enter search terms in the "From," "To," or "Subject" fields.
- For searching the message body, enter terms in "Has the words,"
  "Doesn't have," or both.
- Select the checkbox for "Has attachment" to search for messages with
  attachments.
- Select the checkbox for "Don't include chats" to exclude chat
  conversations.
- To restrict your search to messages that are greater than or less
  than a particular size (in MB, KB, or Bytes), use the "Size" fields.
- To restrict your search to particular dates, use the "Date within"
  fields.

1. Once you completed all the required fields, press Tab to the "Search
    Mail" button and press Enter.

    - **Note:** Instead of searching, you can select the Create a
      filter with this search link. This option takes you to another
      form where you can choose what to do with messages that meet
      your search criteria, such as skip the inbox or apply labels.
2. To leave the form without searching, press Escape.
