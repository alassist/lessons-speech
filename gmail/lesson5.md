# Lesson 5

## Inbox navigation

By default, most Gmail inboxes are organized in three tabs:

Primary
:   Your main mail.

Social
:   Mail from social networks and other social sites.

Promotions
:   Deals, offers, and other marketing mail.

This organization makes it easy to focus on messages that are important
to you first and to scan through bulk mail all at once later. You can
choose to cancel any of the non-Primary tabs, moving this type of
messages into the Primary tab. You can also add additional categories as
tabs. Categories are also available to you as labels in the navigation
list.

To change your inbox settings, choose one of these options:

-   After the last inbox tab, choose the option to Select which tabs to
    show or hide.
-   Navigate to the Settings button in the Gmail action bar, then press
    **Enter**. In the Settings menu, select Configure inbox.

In the dialog, select or deselect tabs to enable in your inbox. Options
include Primary (always enabled), Social, Promotions, Updates, and
Forums. Learn more about inbox tabs and categories. You can choose to
show or hide labels with the provided links.

When you navigate in your tabbed inbox, you'll hear "main table tab
list" when you enter the tabs, followed by the tab name, whether the tab
is selected, and the tab order. For example, if the "Primary" tab is
selected, you might hear "Primary, tab selected, 1 of 3 heading." To
move between tabs, press **Tab**. To select the tab, press **Enter**.
While in the list of conversations, you can move to the next tab by
pressing the ` (accent) key.

If you only have the Primary tab enabled, the table tab list isn't
present at the top of your inbox.

## Browse a list of conversations

In Gmail, messages are grouped into conversations. For example, if you
send your friend Kim an email, Kim's response to you is grouped with
your original message in one conversation. When you open any Gmail
label, such as your Inbox, or when you search your mail, Gmail displays
a list of conversations that match that label or search. You can use the
right and left arrows to move back and forth between the navigation list
and the list of conversations.

The list of conversations is formatted as a table. You can use table
navigation, or you can simply press the **up** and **down** arrows, or
“J” and “K”,  to move through the conversation list. You can also
navigate by column using the **Left** or **Right** arrows. You can
then use **Up* or **Down** arrows to move down the list by that
column. You can use this to read only the senders in the conversation,
or only the subject. This allows you to quickly triage your email.You'll hear the
following information about conversations in the list:

-   Selected: By default, the conversation isn't selected. Once you
    select the conversation, by pressing X, you can perform actions on
    it using the action bar.
-   Starred: By default, the conversation isn't starred. Once you star a
    conversation, you can view all the starred conversations under the
    Starred label.
-   Unread: If the conversation contains unread messages, you'll hear
    this announced.
-   Senders: The names of senders that have contributed to the
    conversation. If there are multiple senders, you'll hear a shortened
    list.
-   Number of messages in the conversation, if the conversation has more
    than one message.
-   Date or time: The date or time the email was sent.
-   Subject: The subject of an email and any label that you've assigned
    to conversation. In some cases the first few words of the message,
    the snippet,  might be displayed.
-   Other flags: You'll hear any special information about the
    conversation, such as "Has attachment."
-   Message snippet: You'll hear the beginning of the message text.

The following information is also present in the conversation list, but
isn't announced by default unless you navigate column by column within
the conversation table:

-   Labels: If you've added labels to a conversation, this information
    isn't announced in the inbox.

## Select and take action on conversations

The conversation action bar contains buttons and drop-down menus that
apply to currently selected conversations. The conversation action bar
is different from the Gmail action bar described above, which contains
your Gmail search box.

If no conversation is selected, the conversation action bar includes the
following options:

Select
:   Press Enter to open a drop-down menu with options for selecting
    messages, such as All, None, Read, Unread, Starred, or Unstarred.
    Note that you can do all of these actions with hotkeys.

Refresh
:   Press Enter to load the latest version of your conversation table.

More
:   Press Enter to expand the menu. If no messages are selected, the
    only option under the menu is to Mark all as read.

If you've enabled keyboard shortcuts, simply press “x” to select a
conversation.

When one or more conversations are selected, the conversation action bar
includes the following options:

-   Select: Select or unselect other conversations.
-   Archive: Archiving removes messages from your inbox, but keeps them
    in your account so that you can always find them later. You can find
    archived messages in your All Mail label, or by searching in Gmail.
-   Mark as spam.
-   Delete: Move a conversation to the trash label, where it will stay
    for about 30 days before it's permanently deleted.
-   Move to a label: Move to a label, or to spam or trash. You can also
    create a label or manage labels from this drop-down.
-   Labels: Add or remove a label for the selected conversations, or
    create a new label.
-   More: Press Enter to expand the menu and explore options including
    Mark as read, Mark as not important, Add to tasks, Star, Filter
    messages like these, and Mute.

The following additional buttons are always present:

Inbox section options
:   This pop-up menu gives you the option to show more messages within
    the conversation table, show up to a certain amount of messages,
    hide a section when it's empty of messages, and to View all Inbox
    settings.

Older button
:   This button is enabled if there are older messages matching your
    label or search that aren't currently listed on the page. Press
    Enter to see older conversations.

Newer button
:   This button is enabled if there are newer messages matching your
    label or search that aren't currently listed on the page. Press
    Enter to see newer conversations.

Settings button
:   Press Enter to adjust your settings, send feedback, or get help with
    Gmail.

## Read messages in a conversation {#read-messages-in-a-conversation}

To open a conversation from your inbox or another list, press **Enter**.
The page now displays all the messages in the conversation, as well as
labels, stars, and actions you can perform on the conversation.

Messages can be in one of two formats: expanded or collapsed. Expanded
messages have a heading level 3 and display all information related to
the message. Collapsed messages only display the sender, date, the
beginning text of the message, and whether the message has attachments.

When you first move to a conversation page, the last message and all
unread messages are expanded, and the rest are collapsed. Because only
expanded messages have a heading, you can easily find the unread
messages in a conversation. Use keyboard shortcuts “n” and “p”, when the
screen reader is in focus mode, to navigate to next and previous
messages.

As you browse the conversation page, you'll hear the following
information:

Conversation subject
:   The subject is heading level 2.

Importance marker button
:   Set to on in messages Gmail predicts are important to you.

Labels buttons
:   List of labels that are applied to this conversation. Select Enter
    on a label to view a list of all messages with this label.

    -   Each label has a close button (x). Select the x to remove the
        label from the conversation.
    -   One or more messages.

Attachments area
:   If the message has an attachment, you'll hear "attachments area."
    You can take the following actions on attachments:

    -   Preview: Press Enter on the attachment to preview in Projector.
        To exit, press Escape.
    -   Download: Press Enter on the Download button to save the
        attachment to your computer.
    -   Save to Drive: Press Enter on the Save attachment to Drive
        button to add the attachment to your Google Drive.
    -   Reply button.

The following controls are also present on the page:

Expand all button
:   Expands all messages.

Print all button
:   Prints the conversation.

In new window button
:   Opens the conversation in a new window.
