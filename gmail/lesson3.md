Gmail standard view uses a consistent page structure to enable easy
navigation. The following sections explain what you'll find in each part
of the Gmail interface.

### Main content

The main content section of the page is where you can browse and read
your emails. When you first sign in to Gmail, your focus is in the main
content section, on the first message in your inbox. You'll hear
information about the email, and you can press Enter to open the
message.

<aside>
<p><b>Note:</b> For some screen readers, you might need to type the shortcut j
to move to the first message. (JAWS users, remember to turn off the
virtual cursor to use this keyboard shortcut. For NVDA users, press
<b>Insert+Space</b> to Turn Off Browse Mode.)</p>
</aside>

The ARIA landmark for this section is “Main.” When you're viewing a list
of conversations, the heading is "Conversations." When you're viewing an
individual conversation, the heading is the subject.

Aria Landmarks are landmarks, which you can traverse with the “D” key in
NVDA, and the “r” key with jAWS. When headings are given, it is assuming
that you are using Gmail with your screen reader’s navigation features,
and not with Gmail’s operation keyboard commands.

### Compose button

The Compose button lets you start composing a new email. When your
screen reader's browse mode function is turned off if necessary,
pressing the letter "C" will activate the compose button. You'll find
more details about composing messages below.

### Navigation list

The navigation list is always present on the page. With the virtual PC
cursor off in JAWS, or Focus Mode on in NVDA, use the right and left
arrows to move between the navigation list and the main content area
of the page.

The ARIA landmark for the navigation list is "Navigation," and the
heading is "Labels."

The navigation list includes the labels, commonly called “folders,” in
your Gmail account, such as Inbox, Sent mail, Drafts, and others. When
you select a label in the navigation list, the main content section of
the page displays the conversations for the selected label. Some of the
labels might be followed by a number in parentheses, indicating the
number of conversations within the label that contain unread messages.

From the main content (conversations list), with NVDA set to Focus
Mode, press the **Left Arrow** to move to the “labels” section. Move
to a label with the **Up** and **Down** arrows, and press **Enter** on
one. Now, you’ll be placed in the content of that label. If you move
to the labels list and don’t want to select one, just press **Right
Arrow**, and you’ll be placed back into the content area.

Here are options that can appear in your list of labels:

Inbox
:   Conversations that contain incoming messages.

Starred
:   Conversations that you've marked with a star.

Important
:   Conversations that Gmail predicts are important to you.

Sent Mail
:   Conversations that contain messages that you've sent.

Drafts
:   Conversations that include a message you were writing and haven't
    yet sent.

Categories
:   Conversations categorized by type, such as promotional emails.

Your other labels
:   Any other labels you created.

More labels section
:   Other, less-frequently used labels, such as spam and trash.

### Chat or Hangouts

The Chat or Hangouts section of the page allows you to start chat and
video hangouts.

The ARIA landmark for this section is "Complementary." If you've
upgraded to the new Google Hangouts, the heading is "Hangouts." If
you're using the old chat, the heading is "Chat." For the best
experience with a screen reader, we recommend the new Google Hangouts.

### Google bar

The Google bar provides links and pop-up menus related to your Google
Account, such as other Google applications, account notifications, and
the link to sign out of your account.

The ARIA landmark for this section is "Banner."

The following links and pop-up menus are available in the Google bar:

Apps
:   This pop-up menu opens to allow you to navigate to other Google
    applications.

Unread notifications
:   This pop-up menu opens to show notifications from your account.

Account
:   This pop-up menu enables you to sign out, add an account, manage
    your account, or view Google's privacy policy.

At the top of the application, near the Google bar, you'll also hear two
hidden links for screen readers: basic HTML view and accessibility
documentation.

### Gmail action bar

The Gmail action bar lets you search your Gmail account or navigate to
your Contacts and Tasks lists.

The Gmail action bar includes the ARIA landmark and heading "Search."

The following options are available in the Gmail action bar:

Gmail link
:   Link to current page. Press Enter to refresh.

Search Gmail edit box
:   Type search terms to find Gmail messages. You'll learn more about
    search later in this course.

Terms & Privacy
:   Link to Google's Legal notices, Privacy and Program policies, and
    Terms of Service.
