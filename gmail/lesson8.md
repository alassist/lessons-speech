# Lesson 8

Gmail enables you to create labels, apply labels to conversations, and
use labels for finding conversations. For example, you can create a
"Vacation" label to mark conversations related to your upcoming
vacation.

Labels that you've created are included in the navigation list. You can
select any label in the navigation list to bring up all conversations
that have that label. You can also search for conversations in a label
by using the label: search operator (e.g. label:vacation).

## Adding a label

To add labels to conversations, follow these steps:

1.  In any conversation list, select the checkbox next to a message to
    select it. If you're using keyboard shortcuts, simply press x. If you're already viewing a single conversation, you can
    skip this step.
2.  Press L to open the labels menu, or navigate to the labels menu in
    the conversation action bar and press Enter.
3.  Navigate down the list, then press Enter to apply the label.

        to the Create button and press Enter.
    -   Open the labels menu by pressing L or navigating to the
        conversation action bar and selecting the labels menu. Navigate
        to the very end of the list to the "Create new" option. Enter
        the new label name, then press Tab to the Create button and
        press Enter.
