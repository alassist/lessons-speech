Don\'t want to get mom mad if she\'s a dinosaur! Roar!

Quick reminder to continue using what you learned in lesson 1 as you
work through this and all future lessons.

## Welcome to Lesson 2

It\'s about time to address the elephant in the room. Have you heard
JAWS read \"heading level 1 or 2 or 3\" as you\'ve been navigating
through these lesson pages? Well, that\'s because webpages are organized
using headings. They organize information from big ideas to smaller
ideas.

Heading 1 is used for our big idea. For example, heading 1 on this page
says the lesson title. This is the big idea, or main focus of this page.

A heading level 2 will take that big idea and break it into smaller
components. For example, think of a book. The cover has the title, or a
heading level 1, but then the subsequent chapters in the book would be
read as heading level 2.

A heading level three would organize even smaller ideas. Let\'s think of
that book again. Let\'s pretend it\'s a textbook. I know, I know, EW!
But hear me out. The cover would have the title, or heading level one.
The chapters would be read as heading level two. And if there were
subsections in those chapters, such as \"introduction,\" \"conclusion,\"
or \"vocabulary,\" these would be read as heading level three.

This pattern can continue until you reach heading level six.

## Navigating Headings

To navigate to the next heading using JAWS, press the h key. This is
called single key navigation because you are only pressing one key to
move between elements. Try it now to reach the next heading.

Good work. Now press the down arrow.

You can also navigate to a previous heading. Do this by pressing the
shift key + the h key. Go on. Try it out! I\'ll wait here.

### Grouping Headings

If you want to view all headings on a page at once, you can press the
JAWS key + the F6 key. All available headings will be listed. Navigate
the list by using your up and down arrows. Press enter on the one you
wish to view.

Okay! Now let\'s try an activity. Navigate to the next heading by
pressing the h key.

**Got You!** If you\'ve landed here, I caught you. You only pressed the
down arrow. Come on, press that h key.

### Practice Activity

Your mission, so you choose to except, is to find the hidden message
spread across all of the headings below. But listen carefully, because
as you hear each new clue, the navigation key could change, or the type
of heading you are looking for may switch. Press your down arrow to hear
your first clue!

Clue: Use the h key to find the next heading level three. Your 1st word
of the mystery phrase will be waiting.

## A baker\'s

### Dozens: You found the 1st mystery word! Your next word is in the next heading level 1.

This is not a heading. This is static text. Static text is the lowest
item in the order of information organization on a web page, it provides
supporting information for whatever came before it in that section.

### Chocolate chip cookies

#### With extra sugar and extra chocolate chips!

# OF: Congratulations! You found it. Reminder, a heading level 1 is the topmost organizational element in a section on a web page. Press the down arrow to hear the next clue.

Clue: Let\'s try something new. We are looking for a heading level 5,
but, instead of using the h key to find it, can you just press the
number 5, located in the row of keys above your top row of letters.

# Sports

## Outside

### In the summer

#### In the water

##### Diving: Yes, you found it! You have discovered that you can navigate by specific level of organization. You can press any numbers 1 through 6 to get to that level of heading (if it exists) on a webpage. Arrow down for your final clue.

Clue! Your final clue! You will need to use your h key to navigate
through the following headings. Your final word is in the heading level
that is not the same. Listen carefully! And once you find the final
word, use your down arrow for your last set of instructions.

## Monkeys

## Panda bears

## Tigers

### Dolphins

I hope you kept track of all of the mystery words! Now it\'s time to put
them all together for the correct phrase. Use your down key to go
through the choices and press enter on the correct option.
