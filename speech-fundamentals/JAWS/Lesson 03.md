Those crazy dolphins!

## Welcome to the practice with links page.

Links are what make the internet so expansive! One page goes to another,
and another, and another, and so on! You\'ve already been interacting
with links through these lessons. Have you noticed JAWS say \"link\" as
it reads your answer choices? You are pressing enter on a link to the
page associated with that word or phrase.

There are several ways of navigating through links:

You can use your tab key to navigate link to link.

**TRY IT:** Press the tab key. Listen. Press enter. Follow the link.

[Example 1](jaws-example-1.html)

You can also press the u key to navigate with an \"unvisited link\".
This is another example of single key navigation.

**TRY IT:** Press the u key. Listen. Press enter. Follow the link!

[Example 2](jaws-example-2.html)

If you have visited a page in the past, odds are that you interacted
with one or more links on that page. JAWS will read these previously
visited links as \"visited link\". You can easily navigate to these
visited links by pressing the v key. This can be helpful if you
frequently visit the same page and interact with many of the same links.

**TRY IT:** press the v key. JAWS should take you to the two links you
followed from above.

### Grouping Links

To view a list of all available links on a page, regardless if they are
visited or not, press the JAWS key + the F7 key. This will produce a
list of all links on the page. Use your up and down arrows to navigate
through the list. Press enter on the link you want to visit.

**Try It:** Press JAWS key + F7. Use your arrows to go through the
links. Locate the example 3 link. Press enter. Return to this page. To
exit the list of links, press escape.

## The Activity!

### Instructions:

Read the silly story below. When you get to a link, press enter to
follow the link. Find the mystery number, and come back to finish
reading the story. Once you collect 3 numbers, select the correct code
from the answers at the bottom of the page.

### Silly Story

Once there was a dragon who wanted to get tacos from the local taco shop
on taco Tuesday. But something always seemed to go wrong.

First, he waited patiently in line, tail tucked sweetly between his back
paws. You know, taco chefs can occasionally be intimidated by spiky
tails.

He scrubbed the grime from the folds of his wings. He even tried to
gargle extra swimming pool water to get rid of the smokey aftertaste on
his breath. But when he got to the counter to order, the lady turned the
poor dragon away, saying \"We don\'t serve dragons who don\'t wear
[shoes](jaws-course-shoes.html).

So our hungry dragon messaged his good pal Unicorn to go shopping and
find some taco worthy shoes. And though it took some time, And even
though the shoe salesman had to stitch together multiple pairs to create
a shoe that would fit his non-human foot, he returned to the taco shop
sporting some stylish new kicks.

Again he waited in line, dreaming of crunchy tortilla shells and spicy
salsa. And again, the lady at the counter turned him away, saying \"we
can\'t serve customers who don\'t wear [socks](jaws-course-socks.html)
with their shoes. Surely that\'s obvious.\"

So once again, and even more hungry now, the dragon sadly left the shop
without crunchy tortillas or boats of spicy salsa, in search of a sock
store.

Luckily, just 3 doors down from the taco shop was **Sock Monster** a
very popular sock store. The salesperson was happy to help the dragon
pick out some stylish socks that matched his shoes very well. Surely now
he would be able to enjoy some tacos.

The hungry dragon waited in line, dreaming of that 1st bite of a juicy
chicken taco, the melted cheese oozing down his muzzle. He was so
excited he was bouncing with anticipation in his new shoes and socks.
But when the dragon reached the counter, the lady turned him away once
more, saying \"we can\'t serve dragons who refuse to wear a
[shirt](jaws-course-shirt.html) to lunch.\"

The dragon had never felt so sad. He had never felt so hungry. But he
would not let the taco shop rules stop him from dreaming of a delicious
lunch. But this time the dragon had some help from a fellow taco
enthusiast.

A customer sitting in the taco shop had seen the whole fiasco. He saw
the dragon turned away again and again, and felt so bad for him.

See, it had been cold that day. The customer, known as Frank, had warn a
big sweatshirt to lunch, but sitting inside it was warm. And being a
bigger fella, he thought maybe the sweatshirt would fit the hungry
dragon, just a bit snug.

The hungry dragon was so thrilled to receive Frank\'s offer of the
sweatshirt. He tucked into the green hoodie shyly. It matched his scales
and the fringe in his socks. And he stepped up to the counter to order.
This time all the lady had to say was \"what can I get you today sir?\"

## Pit Stop

Before you select the correct code number, try pressing v to hear if
JAWS takes you to any \"visited links.\"

## Now, what was the mystery code?

You can use your tab key or the u key to navigate between the links
below.

[22 33 44](#){#MyLink onclick="Incorrect()"}
