## What's the Virtual Cursor?

Up until now we have been focusing on keyboard navigation, and
navigating across the web using elements. But as we near the end of our
course, we need to discuss something a bit more pressing. The Virtual
Cursor.

### Cursors

There are 3 types of cursors in the JAWS ecosystem.

- PC Cursor: the carrot, or blinking cursor on the screen. The cursor
  often seen in word processing documents.
- JAWS Cursor: the cursor that goes where ever the mouse can go.
- Virtual Cursor: The cursor we have been working with throughout most
  of this course. It allows you to use your arrows and keyboard
  navigation to navigate applications such as web browsers. It is not
  visible.

### More Explanation Please

Let's think about the web pages we have been exploring. When we press
the h key, we are telling JAWS to navigate to the next heading and read
it to us. When we press the b key, we are telling JAWS to navigate to
the next button and read it to us. We are not interacting with the
actual website until we hit enter to select that button, or link, or
checkbox. It is just simply being read to us.

You might like to think of the virtual cursor as JAWS's eyes. When you
press keys, you are talking to or interacting with the screen reader
first. JAWS is telling you what it sees.

Generally speaking, the virtual cursor makes navigation similar to the
experience of navigating through a word processing document. But, there
are some websites, programs, or applications in which the experience
with the virtual cursor **on**, causes the user experience to be clunky
and inefficient. There are keyboard commands embedded in the application
or website that cannot be accessed with virtual cursor **on**. These
keyboard commands have been designed by the developers of the website,
and make navigating their application easy and efficient. But the only
way to access this efficient, easy, less time-consuming method of
navigation is by turning off the virtual cursor.

### Turning on/off the Virtual Cursor

You can think of the virtual cursor as a light switch. You can toggle it
on and off. To do so, you will press the JAWS key and the letter z. For
desktop layout, this means insert + z, and for laptop layout, this means
caps lock + z.

### Real World Application

The Google Suite applications are a great example of different user
experiences with and without the virtual cursor on. Did you know that
when you go to Google Drive, or g-mail, or Google Calendar there is an
entire toolbox of keyboard commands that you could be using to make your
experience run much more smoothly?

These commands are not screen reader specific. Anyone can use them. Me,
you, your friends, your teacher, ANYONE!

The only problem is that when the virtual cursor is **ON** these
keyboard commands do not work, because when you press keys on your
keyboard, you are first talking to the screen reader, and not the Google
application. We need to place your screen reader in a mode that allows
the keys that you press to be directly communicated to the application
instead of the screen reader. We need to turn the virtual cursor
**off.**

The scope of this course does not involve us diving into the intricacies
of Google Suite applications with the virtual cursor off, but I invite
you to check out the following links once you've built an understanding
of the virtual cursor.

Pro Tip: To quickly enable keyboard commands in a Google application,
press the ? and a dialogue box will open up. Use your tab key until you
hear \"enable\". Press enter. Tab to the \"close\" button. Press enter.
You are set!

## Practice

Want to see the virtual cursor on/off phenomenon in action?

Visit the website below. When you first load the page, you will have the
virtual cursor on by default. Press any letter on the keyboard. Listen
to JAWS describe what it sees. Next, turn off the virtual cursor by
pressing JAWS key + z. Then press any letter on the keyboard. Listen to
what happens next!

Once you are done playing the piano, come back here by pressing alt +
left arrow.
