## Editing and Proofreading Text

### First thing's first: let's review

- To navigate to the next line, press the down arrow.
- To navigate to the previous line, press the up arrow.
- To navigate to the next character, press the right arrow.
- To navigate to the previous character, press the left arrow.
- To navigate to the next word, press the control key + the right arrow.
- To navigate to the previous word, press the control key + the left
  arrow.

We can put these keystrokes to good use when proofreading and editing
our work.

If we have misspelled a word, we may need to navigate word by word to
first place the JAWS focus on that word, then we will need to navigate
character by character to find the incorrect letter(s) and delete.

Or, we may be reviewing our work by carefully listening to the text as
we navigate line by line using our down arrow. When we hear a mistake,
we can navigate to the word or words by pressing the control button plus
left or right arrow. And lastly, we can navigate using the left or right
arrow to place our cursor behind the letter or letters we wish to
correct.

### Let's Give it a Try

I was sleepy last night when I wrote the following few sentences. I'm
hopeful that you can help me find the errors.

Use your editing navigation skills to find the mistake.

**Sentence 1:** After flying a long way, a thirsty crow was wandering
the frest in search of water.

### What's the correct spelling of the misspelled word in the sentence above?
