## Time for Tables

### What is a table?

What is a table in terms of our computer? Well, sometimes your computer
may be sitting on a table, or a desk, but there are also tables you will
interact with on your computer. You will interact with tables in
documents, on websites, and in different applications like the calendar.

Tables are made up of columns, which are vertical (up and down)
representations of information, and rows (left to right) representations
of information.

*Real World Example:* Think of a movie theater. The audience sits in
rows, or lines of seats that stretch from the left to the right side of
the room. Now, let\'s think about the front row, behind each seat in
this 1st row there is another audience member, and another behind them,
and another behind them, until you reach the back of the theater. These
are our columns.

### What information is in a table?

Great question! On the internet, tables may display the hours of
operation for a business, the prices of various products, or the times
of different events.

### Structure

Tables are like grids, or graph paper. They are constructed of
individual cells that make up rows and columns. The top row of the table
will contain all of the names of each column. You read this top row left
to right to identify how many columns are in the table, and what
information you will find in the cells as you navigate down each column.

## JAWS and Tables

To navigate to the next table using JAWS, you will press the t key. To
navigate to the previous table, you will press shift + t.

Once the focus has been placed on the table, there are two ways to read
the information.

The first way is to hold down the alt and control buttons while pressing
either the right, left, up, or down arrow. You will continue to hold
down control and alt as you navigate the table.

If you press the up arrow while holding alt and control you will
navigate to the cell directly above your current location.

If you press the right arrow while holding alt and control, you will
navigate to the cell directly to the right of your current location. The
same pattern holds true for holding the down and left arrows.

The second method does not require holding down the control and alt keys
as you are navigating the table, you can use the layered command, *table
layer mode*.

First, press the JAWS key plus the space bar. You will here a click.
Next, press the t key for table. JAWS will announce that you have
entered table layer mode. If you are not in a table and try to enter
table layer mode, JAWS will announce \"not in a table.\"

## Practice with Tables

There are 3 tables on this page. Navigate to each table and explore the
contents by using one of the above-mentioned strategies.

The answer to the quiz question at the end of this lesson will be found
in one of these tables.
