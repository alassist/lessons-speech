## YAY! IT\'S DONE! THANK YOU!

Here\'s the finished story with all of your corrections.

After flying a long way, a thirsty crow was wandering the forest in
search of water. Finally, he saw a pot half-filled with water. He tried
to drink from it but his beak wasn\'t long enough to reach the water
inside. He then saw pebbles on the ground and one by one, he put them in
the pot until the water rose to the brim. The crow then hastily drank
from it and quenched his thirst.
