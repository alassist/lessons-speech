## Time for Inputting Text

Now that we have worked on skills for navigating text to look for
errors, in other words proofreading, let's input our own text in some
edit fields.

### What You Need to Know

To navigate to the next edit field, press the e key. Again, to navigate
to the previous edit field, press the shift + e key.

You will hear JAWS say \"edit field\", at which point you need to press
the enter key to enter the field. You will hear a \"bong\" which means
you have entered the field and can now start writing your text.

Once you are finished writing, you will hit the escape key. You will
hear another \"bong\" noise, which means you have exited the edit field.

### Let's Try It

Please write your name in the field below:

Please write the word \"banana\" in the field below:

Please write a sentence about your day in the space below:

### Let's Add in Some Editing

Listen carefully to all of the instructions:

*Task 1:* Write the word \"train\" in the space below:

Now, can you please return to the edit field above where you wrote
train, and change ONLY the first letter to the letter b: Note: remember
how to navigate character by character. You only need to delete one
letter, not the entire word.

*Task 2:* Write the sentence \"I want some ice cream.\" in the space
below:

Now, using your navigational skills, change ONLY the word \"want\" to
\"have\". Note: you only should be deleting one word, not the entire
sentence. Remember how to read word by word.

*Task 3:* Write the following sentence in the space below. \"It is time
to party.\"

Now, change \"It is\" to \"It's.\"

Oh yeah, and can you change the period to an exclamation mark.

Oh, I forgot, one last thing. Change \"party\" to \"learn\".

Nice Work!

## Let's finish with a riddle.
