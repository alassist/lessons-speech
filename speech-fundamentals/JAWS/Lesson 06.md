## JAWS Lesson 6: Combo Boxes 

### Guess what! We're Working with Another Element!

A combo box! Yes, I know what you are thinking, a combo box sounds like
something delicious you would purchase from Burger King, but it's
actually something we can interact with to make selections. You will
make one selection out of many options. Also, sometimes a combo box may
also be called a list box.

It can be a little tricky at first to interact with a combobox, but
you've done so well this far, so I'm sure you are up to the challenge.

To interact with a combo box follow these steps

- Press the c key to navigate to the next combo box.
- Next, press the enter key to enter the combo box or list box.
- Press control + down arrow to expand all options. JAWS will say \"open
  list box\".
- Use your up and down arrows to navigate through choices.
- Press enter on the option you wish to choose.
- You will either be automatically removed from the box, or you will
  need to press the escape key to exit the combo box or list box. You
  know you are out of it if you hear JAWS make a \"dong\" noise.

Wow, that's a bit of a process. But once you practice, I'm sure it
will feel like second nature. Below you will find some practice combo
boxes.
