Today, Google Chrome is the most popular web browser. Other browsers
include Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari, and Opera. Each one has its
own look and feel, but they have the same goal: to display web pages
correctly. For most web pages, any well-known browser will work.
However, if you are using a screen reader, currently we recommend
[Mozilla
Firefox](https://download.mozilla.org/?product=firefox-stub&os=win&lang=en-US)
or [Google Chrome](http://www.chrome.google.com/) paired with [Non
Visual Desktop Access](http://www.nvaccess.org/download/) (NVDA) for
optimum web accessibility. Internet Explorer is no longer supported, and
should not be used. Instead, Microsoft has released [Microsoft
edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/microsoft-edge). This
browser is usable with screen readers, but has not yet reached parity
with Google Chrome.

## Web browsing with a screen reader

When using a web browser without a screen reader, a sighted reader
will use their eyes to read content, and the mouse to interact with
it: clicking links, checking checkboxes, selecting a radio button, or
choosing from a combo box.

With screen readers on Windows, like NVDA, there are different “modes”
for reading and interacting. These modes are *Browse mode* and *focus
mode* for NVDA, *Scan Mode*, for browsing, with Narrator* or *Forms
mode* for interacting, with JAWS. In this lesson, we’ll focus on
NVDA’s Browse mode and Focus mode.

### Browse Mode

Browse mode lets you “browse” a web site using the **Arrow keys** and
Quick Navigation keys. Quick navigation keys will be discussed later
on. Browse mode is on by default, and is likely what you are using to
read this page. For example, if you pressed **Insert + Down Arrow** to
read this page, you are using Browse mode to do it.

### Focus mode

Focus mode is what you use to interact with most forms. Typing into
text fields, choosing items from combo boxes, or using web apps like
Gmail and Google Docs, and tabbing to controls that are inaccessible
in browse mode, are all done in Focus Mode. To switch to Focus mode,
press **Insert + Space**. Press **Insert + Space** again to switch
back to browse mode, or alternatively press **Escape**. This allows
you to enter forms, like text fields, then quickly return to reading
the site.

Note that some form fields, like check boxes, buttons, and radio
buttons do not require you to turn on Focus mode, simply press
**Space** or **Enter** to activate them.
