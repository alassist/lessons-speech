# Lesson 3.5

If you have more than one computer in your household, you might want to
connect all of them to the Internet. The easiest way to do this is by
creating a home network.

In a home network, a router (which could be a wireless router) connects
all of the computers to your modem, and it also connects them to each
other. That means you can move files from one computer to another or
even play multiplayer games with your family.

Your home network can connect many devices besides computers. Many
phones, printers, mp3 players, video game consoles, and Digital Video
Recorders (DVRs) are equipped with wireless cards and often require
little setup to connect them to your home network.
