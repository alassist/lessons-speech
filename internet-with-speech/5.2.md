# Lesson 5.2

There are numerous search engines out there, but the most popular ones
are [Google](http://www.google.com/),
[Duck Duck Go](http://www.duckduckgo.com), and
[Bing](http://www.bing.com/). Each one has its own unique features, but
the process of doing a search is very similar on each.

## Using the Search Bar

Most browsers have a built-in search bar, located to the right of the
address bar. To do a search, just press **Control + K** and then type
what you're looking for (known as the search terms) in the search bar,
and then press **Enter**. Your browser will then take you to the search
engine's web site to show you the search results, which is a list of
all of the web sites that contain your search terms.

On modern browsers like Chrome and Firefox, the search bar is not needed, as you can search from within the address bar.

Many browsers allow you to add to, or change, the search engines used by the search bar.
