# Lesson 5.2

## Introduction
While there are many search engines available, some of the most widely used ones include:
- [Google](https://www.google.com)
- [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) (privacy-focused)
- [Bing](https://www.bing.com)

Each search engine has unique features, but the basic search process remains consistent across all of them.

## Performing a Search
Modern browsers offer two main ways to search:

### 1. Address Bar Search (Recommended)
- Press **Alt + D** to focus the address bar
- Type your search terms
- Press **Enter** to search using your default search engine

### 2. Dedicated Search Shortcuts
- Press **Control + K** to focus the search bar
- Type your search terms
- Press **Enter** to see results

Note: Most modern browsers use a unified address/search bar (often called the "omnibox"), making the separate search bar obsolete.

## Search Tips for Windows Users
- Use **Control + L** as an alternative to focus the address bar
- Use **Tab** and **Shift + Tab** to navigate search results
- Press **F6** to move between different parts of the browser window
- Use **Control + F** to search within a webpage after getting your results

## Practice Exercise
1. Open your preferred Windows browser
2. Try searching using both **Alt + D** and **Control + K**
3. Practice navigating search results using keyboard shortcuts
4. Try different search terms to see how results change
