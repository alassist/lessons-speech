# Lesson 5.3

After you do a search, glance over the first page of search results. Did it return what you are looking for, or is it just a lot of unnecessary "junk?"

If your search results don't seem very good, you may need to try different search terms. Remember, the search engine can't read your mind; it just looks for matching words. For example, if you just search for the word polish, the search engine doesn't know whether you're looking for shoe polish or a history of the Polish language!

You could improve your search results by searching for shoe polish. However, that still may return a wide variety of web sites, such as:

-   Stores that sell shoe polish
-   Guides on how to polish shoes
-   The history of shoe polish
-   And probably much more

To get the best results, ask yourself: What exactly am I looking for? Specific terms usually return better results.

## Related Searches

A search engine will often recommend related searches that may be mor specific than the search terms you used. Related searches are usuall listed at the bottom of the page. Bing also lists them to the left o the search results.

![Related searches can help you narrow down you search.](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/l8zNTRRi62yrWyBKkWfzr7fkhkc7-Ji_ONUPYwRY38aGckhDOg3iK0MwdbWzVWSofMY1w4z9yEaEmvjmnQZMZIm0zjPrH-T4qhwWzashURwA6M4YOtG6-40F4kkcPs8f8i4UAE0)

## Advertisements

Search engines may include advertisements along with the search results These ads are picked by the search engine based on your search terms and they look a lot like the actual search results. While they may b useful in some cases, it's usually more effective to focus on th "regular" search results.

Google puts its ads (which it calls Sponsored Links) at the top and t the right of the search results.

## Navigating search results with a screen reader

Headings are key to search result navigation. Use the “H” key, when in
Browse mode, to skip to the next heading. In most search engines
search results are among them. Try this with Google. Complete the
following steps by reading each step, then when applicable, using the
**Control + Tab** command to switch from the new tab back to this one
to read the next step. Note that **Control + TAB** Moves to the next tab, while **Control + Shift +
Tab** moves to the previous one.

- Open a new tab with **Control + T**.
- The address bar can also be used as a search bar, so type “screen   reader” into the box.
- Press **Enter**. The Google search engine will load with your   results.
- Press “H” to navigate to the next heading. Keep pressing “H” until   “search results” is spoken.
- The next time you press “H”, you will be on the first search result   or the first heading of a group of similar search results.
- To find out if you are on a search result, listen for the word “link.”
  - If you hear the word “link,” you’ve found a search result.
  - If not, press “h” again, until you hear a “link.”
- Find the result "screen reader - Wikipedia" and press **Enter** to go there.
- Read the page if you want, then close the tab
