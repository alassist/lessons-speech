# Lesson 7.1

## Viewing history

Browsers are a great way to get information from several places. But
what about finding all that information again after a day of
searching? You already know about jumping back to the previous page
with **Alt + Left Arrow**, and forward with **Alt + Right Arrow**.
Your browser keeps track of all the pages that you visit, unless you
are in private browsing mode. This is called the browser *history*.

To access the browser history, on Firefox or Google Chrome, press
**Control + H**. Now, use **Tab** to find the tree view. In a tree
view, you can use the **up** and **down** arrow keys to navigate the
list, and **Right** and **Left** arrows to *expand* or *collapse*
lists within the main list. The tree view will have pages you've
visited, some grouped into dates and times, like "this morning," "Last
night," "Last week," and "six months ago." Press **Right arrow** on
these closed items to open them, and view the history items inside. To
close the list, press **Left Arrow**. To open a page from history,
press **Enter** on it.

On Microsoft Edge, just press **Control + H**, which will land you on a tree
view of history. Use the **Context menu**  to find actions, like open
or delete. If this doesn't work, you may need to use your screen
reader's mouse commands in order to open history items.
