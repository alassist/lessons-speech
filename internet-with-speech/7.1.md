## Viewing history

Browsers are a great way to get information from several places. You
already know about jumping back to the previous page with **Alt + Left
Arrow**, and forward with **Alt + Right Arrow**. Your browser keeps
track of all the pages that you visit, unless you are in private
browsing mode. This is called the browser *history*.

To access the browser history, on Firefox or Google Chrome, press
**Control + H**. Now, use **Tab** to find the tree view. In a tree view,
you can use the **up** and **down** arrow keys to navigate the list, and
**Right** and **Left** arrows to *expand* or *collapse* lists within the
main list. The tree view will have pages you've visited, some grouped
into dates and times, like "this morning," "Last night," "Last week,"
and "six months ago." Press *Right **arrow** on these closed items to
open them, and view the history items inside. To close the list, press
**Left Arrow**. To open a page from history, press **Enter** on it.

## Changing History

To see other actions possible with items in history, press the
**Applications** (or **Context**) key. In this menu, use the **Up** and
**Down** arrow keys to move through the items available. These items may
include: Open, Open in new tab, Copy, and Delete. To use one of these
items, press **Enter** on it.
