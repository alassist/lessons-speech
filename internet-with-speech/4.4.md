Many browsers allow you to open a link in a new tab. This allows you to
keep the current page open instead of going directly to the new page.
For example, if you're reading an article that has a link in it, you
can open the link in a new tab so that you can finish reading the
article. Then, you can go to the new tab to view the link.

Tabs are designed to make browsing more convenient. You can open as many
links as you want, and they'll stay in the same browser window instead
of cluttering up your desktop with multiple windows.

-   To open a new blank tab, press **Control + T**
-   To open a link in a new tab, use the context menu on the link and
    select Open in New Tab (the wording may vary from browser to
    browser).
-   To close a tab, press **Control + F4** or **Control + W**
-   If you accidentally close a tab, you can open it back up with
    **Control + Shift + T**
-   To move between open tabs, press **Control + Page Up** or **Control
    + Page Down** or **Control + Tab** and **Control + Shift + Tab**
