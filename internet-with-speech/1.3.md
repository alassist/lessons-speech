You may have heard someone say something like “The server is down” or
“We're having problems with the email server.” A server is a computer
that “serves” many different computers in a network by running
specialized software and storing information. For example, web pages are
stored on servers.

When you access a web page, your computer is acting as a client. A
client runs familiar software such as web browsers or email software,
and it communicates with the server to get the information it requires.

In order for your browser to display a web page, it requests the data
from the server where the page is stored. The server processes the
request, then sends the data to your browser, where it is displayed.

In peer-to-peer (P2P) networks, each computer acts as both a server and
a client. Examples of P2P software include
[Skype](http://www.skype.com/) and
[BitTorrent](http://www.bittorrent.com/).
