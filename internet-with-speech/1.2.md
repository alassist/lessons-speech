The Internet is the largest computer network in the world, connecting
millions of computers. A network is a group of two or more computer
systems linked together.

## There are two main types of computer networks:

Local Area Network (LAN)
: A LAN is two or more connected computers sharing certain resources s
  in a relatively small geographic location, often in the same building. Examples include home networks and office networks.

Wide Area Network (WAN)
: A WAN typically consists of two or more LANs. The computers are
    farther apart and are linked by telephone lines, dedicated
    telephone lines, or radio waves. The Internet is the largest Wide Area Network (WAN) in existence.
