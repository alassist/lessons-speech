## Introduction
Browser bookmarks are digital shortcuts that save the addresses of websites you want to revisit. Like physical bookmarks that hold your place in a book, browser bookmarks help you quickly return to important or frequently visited websites, such as:
- Social media platforms
- Work or school-related pages
- Educational resources
- News sites
- Personal interest websites

## Adding a Bookmark
There are several ways to bookmark a webpage:
1. The quickest method is to press **Control + D**
2. A dialog box will appear where you can:
   - Edit the bookmark name
   - Choose a storage folder
   - Add tags (in some browsers)
   - Click "Done" or press **Enter** to save

## Managing Bookmarks
To access and manage your bookmarks:

### Firefox
- Press **Alt + B** to open the Bookmarks menu

### Microsoft Edge
- Press **Control + Shift + O** to open Favorites
- Use arrow keys to navigate
- Press **Enter** to open a bookmark

To exit any bookmarks menu, press **Escape** until you return to the main browser window.

## Deleting Bookmarks
To remove unwanted bookmarks:
1. Open the Bookmarks menu using one of the methods above
2. Navigate to the bookmark you want to remove
3. Press the **Applications** key (or right-click)
4. Select "Delete" and press **Enter**

Note: While bookmarks take up minimal storage space, maintaining an organized bookmark collection can make navigation more efficient.
