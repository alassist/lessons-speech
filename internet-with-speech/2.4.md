## Lesson 2.4

TV, radio, and the Internet used to be completely separate things, but
that's no longer true with today's technology. You can now watch TV
shows on your computer, and you can connect to the Internet on many TVs
and DVD/BluRay players. In addition, you can listen to online radio from
all over the world, thus granting you greater access to a more diverse
range of media.

### Streaming Media

TV and radio on the Internet are examples of streaming media, which
means the media downloads while it's playing so you don't have to wait
for it to download first. This includes [Apple
Music](https://www.apple.com/apple-music/),
[Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/us/), or [Youtube
Music](https://music.youtube.com).

Not all media is streaming. If you've ever bought music on the Amazon,
iTunes, or Google Play stores, you probably had to wait for it to
download before you could listen to it.

### Media Players and Embedded Media

Media is often embedded in a web page, which means that it plays within
the web browser. Other times, you'll use a separate program called a
media player to play it. Examples include Windows Media Player,
Foobar2000, VLC Media Player, and Groove Music. An iPod contains
built-in media player software that can play various types of files.
