# Lesson 6.3

There are two main uses for tables on the web: for layout and to
organize data. In NVDA, to navigate to the next table, press the “T” key.
The following commands will allow a user to read a data table. It is
important to hold down the Control and the Alt key when pressing the
arrow keys.

| Command                     | Action              |
| --------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Control + Alt + Left arrow  | Move left one cell  |
| Control + Alt + Right Arrow | Move Right one cell |
| Control + Alt + Up arrow    | Move up one cell    |
| Control + Alt + Down Arrow  | Move Down one cell  |

## Sample Tables

The following tables will provide you with some examples as to how to
