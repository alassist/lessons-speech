## Lesson 3.6

With many mobile phones, it's possible to have full Internet access,
allowing you to check your email, download and use apps, and browse the
Web away from home. To do this, you'll need a data plan, which adds an
additional monthly fee to your mobile phone bill. If you use a smart
phone, iPhone or Android, you are required to have a data plan. You'll
want to do some research to find the best plan for you.

It's also important to choose a provider that has good service in your
area. If your phone can't get reception, you won't be able to connect
to the Internet.

Mobile data plans are often referred to as 4G, or LTE, which means it's
the fourth generation of wireless standards.
