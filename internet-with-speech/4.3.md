# Lesson 4.3

## Address Bar

Browsers have an address bar that shows the web address (also called a
URL) of the page you are on. To go to a different page, you can type an
address in the address bar and then press Enter (or Return). To move
your focus to the address bar, press the hotkey of **Alt + D**. If this
ever doesn't work, Press **Control + L**.

## Links

Most of the time, you will get to a different page by opening a link. A
link can be text or an image, and visually, it's usually formatted to
stand out, so mouse users know to click on it. Many text links are blue,
and they may also be underlined.

For example, [this is a link](http://www.alassist.us). It will open a
web page, and you can press **Alt + Left Arrow** to come back to this
page.

A link may lead to another web page, a different part of the same page, or it could lead to a document,
video, or any other type of file. You can use any of your link quick
keys: k for link, u for unvisited link, or v or visited link. You can
also press the **Insert + F7** hotkey to bring up the elements list. If
you know what you're looking for, however, it may be faster to press
**Insert + Control + F** in NVDA, or **Control + F** in JAWS, to find
the item on the page. Just type what you're looking for, and press
**Enter**.

## Navigation Hotkeys

Back, to go back to the previous page in the same tab or window
:   Alt + Left Arrow or Backspace

Forward, to go forward to the previous page in the same tab or window
:   Alt + Right Arrow or Shift + Backspace

Home, to go to the homepage
:   Alt + Home

Open File, to open an HTML file or any other compatible file in the web browser
:   Control + O

Reload, to refresh the page
:   F5 or Control + R

Reload (override cache), to refresh the page, getting all files from the server and using none already stored on the computer
:   Control + F5 or Control + Shift + R

Stop, to stop loading the page
:   Escape

Sometimes, after opening a link, you might want to go back to the
previous page. You can do this using your browser's Back hotkey. Once
you've pressed the Back hotkey, you can press the Forward hotkey to
follow the link again.

When you use the Back and Forward hotkeys, your browser may use its web
cache to display the page. The web cache stores recently-viewed web
pages so that they don't need to be downloaded again. That's usually
good because it speeds up your web browsing, but sometimes you want to
see the most up-to-date information on the page. You can use the Refresh
hotkey (sometimes called Reload) to tell the browser to load the page
again.

If a page is taking too long to load, or if you've typed in the wrong
URL, you use the Stop hotkey to stop the page from loading.

There are some instances where you don't want to use the navigation
hotkeys. For example, in some online stores, you shouldn't refresh the
page after purchasing an item, as it could cause you to purchase the
item twice.

## Search Bar

Most browsers have a built-in search bar for performing web searches.
We'll talk more about those in the next lesson.
