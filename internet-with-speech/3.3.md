## Which Service is Best for Me?

It all depends on where you live and how much speed you need. Internet
Service Providers (ISPs) usually offer different levels of speed based
on your needs. If you're mainly using the Internet for email and social
networking, a slower connection might be all you need, but if you want
to download a lot of music or watch streaming movies, you'll want a
faster connection. You'll need to do some research to find out what the
options are in your area.
