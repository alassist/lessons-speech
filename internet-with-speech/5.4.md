# Lesson 5.4

As you gain experience with search engines, you'll be able to do better
and better searches, which means it will become quicker and easier to
find what you are looking for. Here are a few tips for improving your
searches:

-   Search phrases. Put quotes around a phrase so each word in the
    phrase isn't searched for separately. For example, if you put
    quotes around "free accessible online games," the search engine
    searches for that entire phrase in a web page. However, if you
    simply type free accessible online games, the search engine searches
    for each of the words individually which may not give you the
    results you desire.
-   Exclude words. Use a hyphen (-) at the beginning of a word to
    exclude search results containing it. For example, macaroni -cheese.
    In many search engines the word NOT (in all caps) is used, as in
    macaroni NOT cheese.
-   Use OR. You can use OR (all caps) to include either of two search
    words. For example, soup recipe tofu OR fish should return recipes
    for soup that contain tofu or fish (or both). You could also search
    for soup recipe tofu OR fish OR chicken OR beef.
-   Get Help. Go to your search engine's Help page for more specific
    information on a particular engine.
