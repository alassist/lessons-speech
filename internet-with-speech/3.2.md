# Lesson 3.2

If you've ever surfed the Web, you've probably had to wait for web
pages to load. Media such as videos, music, and even images can take a
long time to load, so faster Internet connections provide a less
frustrating online experience.

### Internet Speed

The speed of your Internet connection is determined by the bandwidth,
which is the amount of data that can move through the connection over a
given period of time. High-bandwidth connections are called broadband.
On the other hand, Dial-up connections have a relatively low bandwidth.

Higher bandwidth means:

-   Faster web pages
-   Faster email services
-   Music and video play more smoothly

Bandwidth is measured in bits per second (bps). For example, a 3 Mbps (3
megabits per second) connection is capable of moving 3 million bits of
data every second, which is more than fast enough to watch a streaming
movie.

## When the Internet is Slow

You may have noticed that your Internet connection is slower at certain
times. That's because the data has to go a long way before getting to
your computer, so there are a lot of places where it can slow down. If
more people are using the Internet at the same time, it's more likely
that there will be "traffic jams" along the way.
