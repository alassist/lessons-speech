It's no secret that more and more the Internet is becoming an integral
part of our everyday lives. But if you are new to the online
experience, it may be a bit overwhelming. You may be wondering, “What
exactly is the Internet, and how does it work?”

In this lesson, we will give a brief overview of the Internet, and we
will talk about some fundamental concepts such as networks, servers, and
clients.

## The Internet Today

In the early days, most people just used the internet to search for
information. Today's Internet is a constantly evolving tool, that not
only contains an amazing variety of information, but also provides new
ways of accessing, interacting and connecting with people and content.

# Lesson 1.2: What is the internet

The Internet is the largest computer network in the world, connecting
millions of computers. A network is a group of two or more computer
systems linked together.

## There are two main types of computer networks:

Local Area Network (LAN)
: A LAN is two or more connected computers sharing certain resources 
  in a relatively small geographic location, often in the same building. Examples include home networks and office networks.

  ![drawing of sample
  LAN](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/5qNO1JxirmWPD5o1fwHmVaAqQO_8skC6dD91Jm-aeB14QgVBLP-RrK2_bX1viiIFWjEggMelBKSBXhFemRWjNkWmNyTOrGBwyO9vkHdzyYBXBP2AOLqQrTRKsC-e-MaT7sEGEEg)

Wide Area Network (WAN)
: A WAN typically consists of two or more LANs. The computers are
    farther apart and are linked by telephone lines, dedicated
    telephone lines, or radio waves. The Internet is the largest Wide Area Network (WAN) in existence.

  ![drawing of sample
  WAN](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/jYNtYWfBXD_Wbs7uNk3kOk6GXr8w-DL8K9OnMo9U-SzDoEapZmbtx3cUm5Tcj0EbLcB5knJ3woYxc3ddWIiZ_hmJ3_jCFPllcbekO-cTUEuE2H7SFE6xDdTl5hl3H4V4T_8_yFg)



# Lesson 1.3: Servers and Clients

![Image of A server with multiple clients](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/jTXNrgJG-26Hlze98yoqqRmeJ1BVsc1inQaPFtjAbPjRfs8QV2KRZZOsNZEhowsMY80qWFtOP0XU0xzZLCTeeJXtHAr-3UQftyUJPPgRNOsAdXbVjp31ayVN5CJD_kponniYBNM)

You may have heard someone say something like “The server is down” or
“We're having problems with the email server.” A server is a computer
that “serves” many different computers in a network by running
specialized software and storing information. For example, web pages are
stored on servers.

When you access a web page, your computer is acting as a client. A
client runs familiar software such as web browsers or email software,
and it communicates with the server to get the information it requires.

In order for your browser to display a web page, it requests the data
from the server where the page is stored. The server processes the
request, then sends the data to your browser, where it is displayed.

In peer-to-peer (P2P) networks, each computer acts as both a server and
a client. Examples of P2P software include
[Skype](http://www.skype.com/) and
[BitTorrent](http://www.bittorrent.com/).



# Lesson 1.4: Did you know?

-   The foundation of the Internet began in 1969, when the US
    Department of Defense created ARPAnet, a project to allow military
    personnel to communicate with each other in an emergency.
-   By 2009, there were over 1.7 billion Internet users---over one
    quarter of the world\'s population.
-   There were over one billion Internet users in 2016. This figure has
    likely increased over the years since then.


# Lesson 2.1: Introduction

![Image of Man with laptop and mobile phone](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/G0wEyv9R6lrsNHy_iOdkDLa6NjZPBJuYMQ9zQChwWeV7XwA3cMmje0r6ocERkHIG4ZHIK32Cd8I8n3hze7KRTvhYa_8a7fFwqRJJRGiUnRJnYylzHIwgBa89u7uuGhZqSy4XSDY)

As the Internet has grown, it has developed into a multifaceted tool
with a vast range of uses. It's now easy to keep in touch with friends,
publish your own articles, or even watch your favorite TV shows using
the Internet.

In this lesson, we'll talk about some of the ways the Internet is used
today, including blogs, social networking, instant messaging, VoIP, and
media.



# Lesson 2.2: The World Wide Web (WWW)

When most people think of the Internet, the first thing they think about
is the World Wide Web. Nowadays, the terms “Internet” and “World Wide
Web” are often used interchangeably---but they're actually not the same
thing.

-   The Internet is the physical network of computers all over the
    world.
-   The World Wide Web is a virtual network of web sites connected by
    hyperlinks (or "links"). Web sites are stored on servers on the
    Internet, so the World Wide Web is a part of the Internet.

## HTML

The backbone of the World Wide Web is HTML files, which are
specially-formatted documents that can contain links, headings, lists,
tables, as well as images and other media. All web browsers can read
HTML files.

![Image of HTML
code](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/kUEFOn9mvXcWzX3bJttJ3HobWqIhrmM1vUDQxQskNRNpVNtc-nRG7ikmjnmZNRuDrXMKjjGvdN1U9aijZfgVvXHaPoPeaIbpSOzLUYVqL51JmNpidh0cBO6GsyTYrBr9KHiQUn8)

### HTML Example

``` {.html}
<h1>This is an example</h1>
<p>This is an example of a paragraph. The less-than and greater-than
symbols enclose a <i>tag</i>, and the slash in the enclosure shows the
ending of any tag that opens and closes, like the paragraph one.</p>
<ul>
<li>This starts a list. This is an unordered list, with list
items.</li>
<li>This is just <b>another</b> list item.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Heading level two</h2>
<p>Headings are created using H1, H2, H3, ETC., tags.</p>
```

#### Results of example

To learn more about HTML, see [This
introduction](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp). To learn
to write HTML and how to develop web apps and sites, see [Free Code
Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org).

## URL

To get to a web page, you can type the URL (Uniform Resource Locator) in
a browser. The URL, also known as the web address, tells the browser
exactly where to find the page. However, most of the time, people get to
a web page by following a link from a different page or by searching for
the page with a search engine.

![Image of An example of a
URL](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/gTCzItbEZC7_EmI7tJNUCYxTkBt-PKlKppKLKnMami5ZtJstN_pzxMWVXPfvB7F6k9UzFF7PD27oKdi41FYm2uC1IDYpc-bPRNgt1h1XWSXYw-K5SpVGAqt2ZqsHN3__K3DWiww)

An Example of a URL
is:

<https://moodle.alassist.us/mod/page/view.php?id=1323>

"HTTP" tells the browser that the Hyper Text transfer Protocol will be
used to fetch the web page. "WWW" is not needed usually, but is there
because it has always been there. "moodle.alassist.us" is the web
address. After the slash is the path, or sometimes instructions, to
get to the desired page. The web server follows the path or
instructions to get to the desired page, then sends that page back to
the user's web browser.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The World Wide Web was created in 1989 by Tim Berners-Lee, a software
engineer. Before then, computers could communicate over the Internet,
but there were no web pages.



# Lesson 2.3: Using the Internet to Communicate

## With a Web Browser

The World Wide Web began as a sort of library of information which was
best suited for learning and research. In other words, most people used
the web for just reading information. Today, the average user has the
ability to shape the web by adding to it.

Blogs allow anyone to be a writer or journalist. With sites like
[blogger.com](http://www.blogger.com/), you can create a blog for free
and add your thoughts to it whenever you want. You don't need to know
HTML to create a blog---the technical stuff has already been created
for you.

![Image of An example of a
blog](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/uqIy1SnXXPkKv3Li-Jc1chYGVnvZOM44kTme8kfgtrQgXsNzgsKG5Jjq6LnXffeEwrQsbRadg23DRyue1sCbPHsUOfunXg8adXcdXwYnvjKxiCxbEoTdFC6DOL5lsmWvMrz9w5M)

Many websites are used as a means for staying in touch with friends,
family, and business contacts. This is known as social networking. With
sites like Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn, you can create an online
profile with information about yourself, as well as pictures and videos.
You can send notes to your friends, receive reminders about your
friends' birthdays, and more.

![Facebook allows you to post your
thoughts](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/Z2ngiBt-qsrZg6PXSGXsLzr8r1S87r1dXQ2zfi-rlWrfuGF1bU2b8MmDeV1k5A9IlZyvBW98KOMGuSnC3fQSKgXZtWhF5jTqV3KVyMYifUXd4kfu3eKPyr7ZYMPrDdVEJ1zOb80)*

## Without a Web Browser

Communication over the Internet is not limited to web browsers. Instant
messaging programs allow you to have conversations with your friends or
just write them a quick note.

![Image of Instant
Messaging](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/lOK1LbnyNEuXlGu4Jwqb0ZaQlTOErpezNM6pPEepHIgEDM3toWzquvpRHGu0Wr3BGZuHWHJdYHrAZ9kaowEeVqxn-WPpPov97VoOFi-_-2pdvVGMjEkHaVC_yA3rO3olgsqmsXk)

VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol), allows you to have telephone
service through an Internet connection. Some VoIP programs, such as
Skype and Zoom, can also do video conferencing.

![Image of Using a video conferencing
program](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Ma3ba7RXjCTPOZv9nvFWRR-0Ymcni7Bv8tlT3tohJ4j2x9XVIGCPmdTx3Ah20TcKQq5HietgzefzImxwXCtPbxJskWtfo4TY4WEyaFotaR5o_5cmKF-0_3sCArAAsm1PcNY8Dc0)

Web browsers are increasingly becoming "all-in-one" programs. So you
might do Instant messaging or video conferencing within a browser.



# Lesson 2.4: Media on the Internet

TV, radio, and the Internet used to be completely separate things, but
that's no longer true with today's technology. You can now watch TV
shows on your computer, and you can connect to the Internet on many TVs
and DVD/BluRay players. In addition, you can listen to online radio from
all over the world, thus granting you greater access to a more diverse
range of media.

![Listening to music on iTunes radio](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/6NglQlGhT2EzDeAb5QM1Sce6-t44NfQ--pos7v-7OWfdi4EXtdfMXOyXhF6skplEbKzO5xCNf9Xsq5R7YxToKG9Xxsage9qBywZm4bU7TC97yzNWtZ2qixl37WjqtiuxLm3cs8o)

## Streaming Media

TV and radio on the Internet are examples of streaming media, which
means the media downloads while it's playing so you don't have to wait
for it to download first. This includes [Apple
Music](https://www.apple.com/apple-music/),
[Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/us/), or [Youtube
Music](https://music.youtube.com).

Not all media is streaming. If you've ever bought music on the Amazon,
iTunes, or Google Play stores, you probably had to wait for it to
download before you could listen to it.

## Media Players and Embedded Media

Media is often embedded in a web page, which means that it plays within
the web browser. Other times, you'll use a separate program called a
media player to play it. Examples include Windows Media Player,
Foobar2000, VLC Media Player, and Groove Music. An iPod contains
built-in media player software that can play various types of files.

![Image of Windows Media
Player](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/gHuO9GidwkTnRiIXCIqZhc99Tooy65zTox6uyuBQAaNxAd1QO9UVf_lOM3Uj_kedXONOuc5LXzWZUVfC0JecgkhbTJWqiyu4k7Px1Ix1jL4d79Wl0Xc6sYHVJdUYwTxgEokzWQ8)


# Lesson 3.1: Introduction

![Connecting to the
Internet](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Gu-fRutISfJbWZ87A1EwAleX1PIDJPCbINxDVbKONdQeUq7FyzIe-AFJrXgiP1uYHN9dVItoQ8KyxpsaDixLWu94LG16pMq3xqNDFhEmLEwbn7cMMokmc1l-gV55cTV6wzQcnK8)

So you're interested in getting an Internet connection in your home, or
maybe you'd just like to upgrade to a faster service. There are a lot
of factors to consider, such as how much speed you need and where you
live.

In this lesson, we'll talk about bandwidth, different types of Internet
service, wireless Internet (Wi-Fi), home networking, and mobile phone
Internet access.



# Lesson 3.2: The Need for Speed

If you've ever surfed the Web, you've probably had to wait for web
pages to load. Media such as videos, music, and even images can take a
long time to load, so faster Internet connections provide a less
frustrating online experience.

## Internet Speed

The speed of your Internet connection is determined by the bandwidth,
which is the amount of data that can move through the connection over a
given period of time. High-bandwidth connections are called broadband.
On the other hand, Dial-up connections have a relatively low bandwidth.

Higher bandwidth means:

-   Faster web pages
-   Faster email services
-   Music and video play more smoothly

Bandwidth is measured in bits per second (bps). For example, a 3 Mbps (3
megabits per second) connection is capable of moving 3 million bits of
data every second, which is more than fast enough to watch a streaming
movie.

## When the Internet is Slow

You may have noticed that your Internet connection is slower at certain
times. That's because the data has to go a long way before getting to
your computer, so there are a lot of places where it can slow down. If
more people are using the Internet at the same time, it's more likely
that there will be "traffic jams" along the way.



# Lesson 3.3: Choosing an Internet service

## Which Service is Best for Me?

It all depends on where you live and how much speed you need. Internet
Service Providers (ISPs) usually offer different levels of speed based
on your needs. If you're mainly using the Internet for email and social
networking, a slower connection might be all you need, but if you want
to download a lot of music or watch streaming movies, you'll want a
faster connection. You'll need to do some research to find out what the
options are in your area.



# Lesson 3.4: Wireless Internet

No matter what type of Internet service you have, it's possible to
connect wirelessly (known as Wi-Fi), as long as you have the right
equipment. Many computers have built-in wireless cards, but if you have
a computer that does not, you can purchase them separately. You'll also
need some type of wireless access point (for example, a wireless router)
that will connect to your modem.

![A Wireless
Router](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/ywvnMhLDqbCjIG8XI7jfzqo1sp9IWwSL5XdN7baYwOPozSffFAzJcMaiSdJuP4hCNn67str_fzVv4rSra4UEmXunVZch2YMbuhjV-PLQxvRGo9GR6_9Y6aSuYWIehVSuLyXvfew)

Whenever you're using any kind of wireless Internet, you'll need to
take extra security measures to protect your private data. Wireless
security standards such as Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) encrypt the data
before it's sent. When you setup your Wi-Fi, you'll want to set up
your wireless security. You will create a username and password that you
can use to securely connect to the Internet.

Some cities provide free, citywide Wi-Fi, which means you may not need
to purchase Internet access or a wireless access point. A list of cities
can be found
[here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipal_wireless_network).



# Lesson 3.5: Home Networking

If you have more than one computer in your household, you might want to
connect all of them to the Internet. The easiest way to do this is by
creating a home network.

In a home network, a router (which could be a wireless router) connects
all of the computers to your modem, and it also connects them to each
other. That means you can move files from one computer to another or
even play multiplayer games with your family.

Your home network can connect many devices besides computers. Many
phones, printers, mp3 players, video game consoles, and Digital Video
Recorders (DVRs) are equipped with wireless cards and often require
little setup to connect them to your home network.

![Using computers on a home
network](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/FhTt_o-qnAUkIpl40DxNTiHMpBtlIONtCd5nPV1xCO__OSayzs6iNA-f0YseGsimIo-97q-lBgR3VrFhDDnlSicW8SwjFuwCkSfmE3U6TAHus9_UgSi7b8OVybtt22UwCLhH860)



# Lesson 3.6: Internet on your Mobile Phone

With many mobile phones, it's possible to have full Internet access,
allowing you to check your email, download and use apps, and browse the
Web away from home. To do this, you'll need a data plan, which adds an
additional monthly fee to your mobile phone bill. If you use a smart
phone, iPhone or Android, you are required to have a data plan. You'll
want to do some research to find the best plan for you.

It's also important to choose a provider that has good service in your
area. If your phone can't get reception, you won't be able to connect
to the Internet.

Mobile data plans are often referred to as 4G, or LTE, which means it's
the fourth generation of wireless standards.

![Using mobile

# Lesson 3.7: the Future of Internet

Today, there are many options for connecting to the Internet, and new
options will continue to become available as different technologies are
developed. So it's important to do some research to find the best
option for you.

There will always be a demand for greater speed and greater
convenience, so you can expect faster and more convenient Internet
services in the near future.

For example, many locations are gaining access to new 4G technologies
such as WiMAX, which allows a computer to connect to the Internet
wirelessly from anywhere within the ISP's network, much like a mobile
phone's data plan. So you'll be able to enjoy wireless Internet when
you're on the go, not just when you're at home.

## Wi-Fi 6

## 5G

> 5G is an investment for the next decade, and in previous mobile

> So following that plan, while we're getting a little bit of 5G right
> now, you should expect the big 5G applications to crop up around 2021
> or 2022. Until then, things are going to be confusing as wireless
> carriers jockey for customers and mindshare.
>
> 5G stands for fifth-generation cellular wireless, and the initial
> standards for it were set at the end of 2017. But a standard doesn't
> mean that all 5G will work the same---or that we even know what
> applications 5G will enable. There will be slow but responsive 5G, and
> fast 5G with limited coverage.

# Lesson 4.1: Introduction

![web browser](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Cq8mq8FzgNjtvdn3nMrp-RXvZWdtpPBeejCsFc9Jeh84vnOg7WG8YqLU3tqjU76a7h0DWyO8eVHMMKxY-rMaqKpFD13pvG63xHtDWif0LqkcO-NeksJ9yIh4Q1kCG_IFsVZzut4)

A web browser is the tool that you use to access the World Wide Web. In
order to get the most out of the Web, it's important to understand the
various features of a browser.

In this lesson, we'll talk about navigating the Web with a browser,
downloading files, bookmarking your favorite web sites, tabbed browsing,
plug-ins and more.



# Lesson 4.2: Common Web Browsers

Today, Google Chrome is the most popular web browser. Other browsers
include Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari, and Opera. Each one has its
own look and feel, but they have the same goal: to display web pages
correctly. For most web pages, any well-known browser will work.
However, if you are using a screen reader, currently we recommend
[Mozilla
Firefox](https://download.mozilla.org/?product=firefox-stub&os=win&lang=en-US)
or [Google Chrome](http://www.chrome.google.com/) paired with [Non
Visual Desktop Access](http://www.nvaccess.org/download/) (NVDA) for
optimum web accessibility. Internet Explorer is no longer supported, and
should not be used. Instead, Microsoft has released [Microsoft
edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/microsoft-edge). This
browser is usable with screen readers, but has not yet reached parity
with Google Chrome.

![Internet
Explorer](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/5RhUA6JJEzbRQ3us8iFScsjYAhFWfqtnZY55dyxEt0Nve_OzWnsnAyC5_xaWr-oWMEnsdI7-jkYgFeI8XebYKwIwAbJEpwlN1bzfcbXwaxo2tETS8G4RtrpXYDv-kMMRCzVR7lQ)
![Firefox](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/0YIIm93Hr9plW8MeOPZ7pL_GRRkCTcLV0sW8QW54iaWLa_SvNTr0Y3OVY__c_dHdaiD9K4Xk3hc9EGFWn1DM4jo_D6-xpklVdBVtif8Vx46SVe8ETpCD6JXjlIeX1yFO4FJIxMg)
![Google
Chrome](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/PrXVb2M-9CETQ6vP_jmZqFLe2qedGx5UROGIWSG2sNkVGgTJwZRq6hfxEF51101e8M4Jf4cztgRB1XnCk4Y4h_2a1i63WfYxA1R28yHPlf5qLTwej1BMJxQVJt-QU1D0g22jtwg)

## Web browsing with a screen reader

When using a web browser without a screen reader, a sighted reader
will use their eyes to read content, and the mouse to interact with
it: clicking links, checking checkboxes, selecting a radio button, or
choosing from a combo box.

With screen readers on Windows, like NVDA, there are different “modes”
for reading and interacting. These modes are *Browse mode* and *focus
mode* for NVDA, *Scan Mode*, for browsing, with Narrator* or *Forms
mode* for interacting, with JAWS. In this lesson, we’ll focus on
NVDA’s Browse mode and Focus mode.

## Browse Mode

Browse mode lets you “browse” a web site using the **Arrow keys** and
Quick Navigation keys. Quick navigation keys will be discussed later
on. Browse mode is on by default, and is likely what you are using to
read this page. For example, if you pressed **Insert + Down Arrow** to
read this page, you are using Browse mode to do it.

## Focus mode

Focus mode is what you use to interact with most forms. Typing into
text fields, choosing items from combo boxes, or using web apps like
Gmail and Google Docs, and tabbing to controls that are inaccessible
in browse mode, are all done in Focus Mode. To switch to Focus mode,
press **Insert + Space**. Press **Insert + Space** again to switch
back to browse mode, or alternatively press **Escape**. This allows
you to enter forms, like text fields, then quickly return to reading
the site.

Note that some form fields, like check boxes, buttons, and radio
buttons do not require you to turn on Focus mode, simply press
**Space** or **Enter** to activate them.



# Lesson 4.3: Navigating to a Website

## Address Bar

Browsers have an address bar that shows the web address (also called a
URL) of the page you are on. To go to a different page, you can type an
address in the address bar and then press Enter (or Return). To move
your focus to the address bar, press the hotkey of **Alt + D**. If this
ever doesn't work, Press **Control + L**.

## Links

Most of the time, you will get to a different page by opening a link. A
link can be text or an image, and visually, it's usually formatted to
stand out, so mouse users know to click on it. Many text links are blue,
and they may also be underlined.

For example, [this is a link](http://www.alassist.us). It will open a
web page, and you can press **Alt + Left Arrow** to come back to this
page.

A link may lead to another web page, or it could lead to a document,
video, or any other type of file. You can use any of your link quick
keys: k for link, u for unvisited link, or v or visited link. You can
also press the **Insert + F7** hotkey to bring up the elements list. If
you know what you're looking for, however, it may be faster to press
**Insert + Control + F** in NVDA, or **Control + F** in JAWS, to find
the item on the page. Just type what you're looking for, and press
**Enter**.

## Navigation Hotkeys

Back
:   Alt + Left Arrow or Backspace

Forward
:   Alt + Right Arrow or Shift + Backspace

Home
:   Alt + Home

Open File
:   Control + O

Reload
:   F5 or Control + R

Reload (override cache)
:   Control + F5 or Control + Shift + R

Stop
:   Esc

Sometimes, after opening a link, you might want to go back to the
previous page. You can do this using your browser's Back hotkey. Once
you've pressed the Back hotkey, you can press the Forward hotkey to
follow the link again.

When you use the Back and Forward hotkeys, your browser may use its web
cache to display the page. The web cache stores recently-viewed web
pages so that they don't need to be downloaded again. That's usually
good because it speeds up your web browsing, but sometimes you want to
see the most up-to-date information on the page. You can use the Refresh
hotkey (sometimes called Reload) to tell the browser to load the page
again.

If a page is taking too long to load, or if you've typed in the wrong
URL, you use the Stop hotkey to stop the page from loading.

There are some instances where you don't want to use the navigation
hotkeys. For example, in some online stores, you shouldn't refresh the
page after purchasing an item, as it could cause you to purchase the
item twice.

## Search Bar

Most browsers have a built-in search bar for performing web searches.
We'll talk more about those in the next lesson.



# Lesson 4.4: Tabbed Browsing

Many browsers allow you to open a link in a new tab. This allows you to
keep the current page open instead of going directly to the new page.
For example, if you're reading an article that has a link in it, you
can open the link in a new tab so that you can finish reading the
article. Then, you can go to the new tab to view the link.

![Three different tabs are open in this
window.](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/V9YCG7iiCAPwytL4LH055phisiBbLlRoBSf2ojyK8sGUn2BKeMYrF6bmbwxqwDo3AzfE7NZFMyq8wl5n0ph9vHgNCxKGiKNSghHFIj1KTckif-w70nSQeAP_xY3pvoB43LmndbA)

Tabs are designed to make browsing more convenient. You can open as many
links as you want, and they'll stay in the same browser window instead
of cluttering up your desktop with multiple windows.

-   To open a new blank tab, press **Control + T**
-   To open a link in a new tab, use the context menu on the link and
    select Open in New Tab (the wording may vary from browser to
    browser).
-   To close a tab, press **Control + F4** or **Control + W**
-   If you accidentally close a tab, you can open it back up with
    **Control + Shift + T**
-   To move between open tabs, press **Control + Page Up** or **Control
    + Page Down** or **Control + Tab** and **Control + Shift + Tab**

![Opening a link in a new
tab](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/E-9etciTIsKfDS9cUtGufqCz0jXGizPYh39kGO-yGHTSjBrfDFMCxaI0NPp38biLuNypHFGQGH7t4rQLCnJRHCU8U70G_DtwFqu7d4nEa6c5XCtUwVYVuUCwRfAza0T0a2QtGLg)



# Lesson 4.5: Downloading Files

Your browser can display many different types of documents, media, and
other files. But there are times when you'll want to access a file
outside your browser. Downloading enables you to do this by putting the
file on your computer in a place where you can access it.

For example, suppose you needed to complete and print a form that you
found online. You could download it to your desktop, then open it with
the appropriate program (such as Microsoft Word) to edit it.

## How to Download a File

If you click on a link to a file, it may download automatically, but
sometimes it just opens within your browser instead of downloading. To
prevent it from opening in the browser, you can use your
**application** or **context menu** key on the link and select "Save
Target As..." (different browsers may use slightly different wording).
You'll be able to choose the folder where the file is saved. It is
important to remember which folder you saved your file in so you can
locate it later.

Since the process of downloading a file varies from site to site, it may
require some practice and experimentation.

![Downloading a
file](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/dh_vCHKblYrkOP_43w5SHYrKqIGKvJlg72Qjcxsy5VJnfu4bv5lkW7AjFnPH1wkql65RM4ALYZGAC98iDNyPVWBHddceL5lBt30dBT9Tu_NkbkhWRqEauDvhwLHdyt3KUYxi1r0)

For various reasons, many sites do not allow you to download content.
For example, YouTube does not offer a way to download its videos.

## Saving Images

Sometimes you might want to save an image to your computer. To do this,
use your **application** or **context menu** key on the link and select
"Save Picture As...".

![Saving a

Some sites do not allow certain images to be saved to your computer,
like Google in its image search.


# Lesson 5.1: Introduction

![search engine](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/TGuGDA0vDZGg-iRQNqHwb5InY9BVbRbNbybC8cFI34SRM5B4gdC9FowB_A5f2aORTTy0L4Pej4W8K9oA1E_pPwUoX_BDoBckUS3Tg1tjMsGx3I6zCniJqZbUUejGW41SFK-YdsM)

With billions of web pages on the World Wide Web, how can you find
exactly what you're looking for? By using a search engine. Search
engines are specialized web sites that help you find what you're
looking for on the Web. All you have to do is type in one or more
keywords, and the search engine will look for matching web sites from
all over the Web. In this lesson, you'll learn the basics of using a
search engine, as well as some techniques you can use to get better
search results.



# Lesson 5.2: Performing a search

There are numerous search engines out there, but the most popular ones
are [Google](http://www.google.com/), [Yahoo](http://www.yahoo.com/),
[Duck Duck Go](http://www.duckduckgo.com), and
[Bing](http://www.bing.com/). Each one has its own unique features, but
the process of doing a search is very similar on each.

## Using the Search Bar

Most browsers have a built-in search bar, located to the right of the
address bar. To do a search, just press **Control + K** and then type
what you're looking for (known as the search terms) in the search bar,
and then press **Enter**. Your browser will then take you to the search
engine's web site to show you the search results, which is a list of
all of the web sites that contain your search terms.

![Built-in search bars make searching more
convenient](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/ltJfRg-pS5qPLr3xxZi3HyxZbB31S50sQqO0QOz-2hpS1fI2J91Ar6I4fuGcXE-vD80q5Di9_dYGU4WErLv0t5QfGXLyA1QE6Z-j0o5ClZ8tXi6t36QzQRISJVTCpNxTwK0LDkI)

Many browsers allow you to add to, or change, the search engines used by
the search bar.



# Lesson 5.3: assessing the search results

After you do a search, glance over the first page of search results. Did
it return what you are looking for, or is it just a lot of unnecessary
"junk?"

If your search results don't seem very good, you may need to try
different search terms. Remember, the search engine can't read your
mind; it just looks for matching words. For example, if you just search
for the word polish, the search engine doesn't know whether you're
looking for shoe polish or a history of the Polish language!

You could improve your search results by searching for shoe polish.
However, that still may return a wide variety of web sites, such as:

-   Stores that sell shoe polish
-   Guides on how to polish shoes
-   The history of shoe polish
-   And probably much more

To get the best results, ask yourself: What exactly am I looking for?
Specific terms usually return better results.

## Related Searches

A search engine will often recommend related searches that may be more
specific than the search terms you used. Related searches are usually
listed at the bottom of the page. Bing also lists them to the left of
the search results.

![Related searches can help you narrow down your
search.](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/l8zNTRRi62yrWyBKkWfzr7fkhkc7-Ji_ONUPYwRY38aGckhDOg3iK0MwdbWzVWSofMY1w4z9yEaEmvjmnQZMZIm0zjPrH-T4qhwWzashURwA6M4YOtG6-40F4kkcPs8f8i4UAE0)

## Advertisements

Search engines may include advertisements along with the search results.
These ads are picked by the search engine based on your search terms,
and they look a lot like the actual search results. While they may be
useful in some cases, it's usually more effective to focus on the
"regular" search results.

Google puts its ads (which it calls Sponsored Links) at the top and to
the right of the search results.

![Ads are usually at the top and to the
right](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/U-keOq50vXFaEZ8HDpSlPrjx3OllnAp2UYhnOg5jijc2naU1kd8xUXkg_Hc09Ot1SSEWJuq8a9GUMaKChiZQnoGhHmAW9NYRBd5J310zE4bd8pN377B9gXncHj0wi34xqP8BvIs)

## Navigating search results with a screen reader

Headings are key to search result navigation. Use the “H” key, when in
Browse mode, to skip to the next heading. In most search engines,
search results are among them. Try this with Google. Complete the
following steps by reading each step, then when applicable, using the
**Control + Tab** command to switch from the new tab back to this one,
to read the next step.

- Open a new tab with **Control + T**.
- The address bar can also be used as a search bar, so type “screen
  reader” into the box.
- Press **Enter**. The Google search engine will load with your
  results.
- Press “H” to navigate to the next heading. Keep pressing “H” until
  “search results” is spoken.
- The next time you press “H”, you will be on the first search result,
  or the first heading of a group of similar search results.
- To find out if you are on a search result, or just another group
  starter, listen for the word “link.”
  - If you hear the word “link,” you’ve found a search result.
  - If not, press “h” again, until you hear a “link.”



# Lesson 5.4: improving your searches

As you gain experience with search engines, you'll be able to do better
and better searches, which means it will become quicker and easier to
find what you are looking for. Here are a few tips for improving your
searches:

-   Search phrases. Put quotes around a phrase so each word in the
    phrase isn't searched for separately. For example, if you put
    quotes around "free accessible online games," the search engine
    searches for that entire phrase in a web page. However, if you
    simply type free accessible online games, the search engine searches
    for each of the words individually which may not give you the
    results you desire.
-   Exclude words. Use a hyphen (-) at the beginning of a word to
    exclude search results containing it. For example, macaroni -cheese.
    In many search engines the word NOT (in all caps) is used, as in
    macaroni NOT cheese.
-   Use OR. You can use OR (all caps) to include either of two search
    words. For example, soup recipe tofu OR fish should return recipes
    for soup that contain tofu or fish (or both). You could also search
    for soup recipe tofu OR fish OR chicken OR beef.
-   Get Help. Go to your search engine's Help page for more specific
    information on a particular engine.



# Lesson 5.5: Specialized Searches

Are you looking for news articles, images, videos, or online stores? You
can use a specialized search to search for a specific type of content.

For example, if you do an image search, the search will find and display
images for you, instead of finding links to pages that may or may not
have relevant images.

![Using an image
search](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/soQq17Kk_LyyicjN8b5_JJhNhouPz-Sjood67Zxo5jkLZpPRwmk2Elv5aWsL8vvegFSW3nDTJ1fP4JsSgjIh-baSmceXQOqQfrLl-2n1MAxxlXkiTU478YE93HnY-4auopa2xBQ)


# Lesson 6.1: reading

There are dozens of keyboard shortcuts that allow you to read content by
line, sentence, word, character, etc. The following is a list of
essential reading shortcuts. With these shortcuts, you should be able to
navigate through most content.

Numpad +
:   Start reading at the screen review position

NVDA + Down Arrow
:   Start reading at the current position

Control
:   Stop Reading

NVDA + Up Arrow
:   Current line

Control + Left Arrow
:   Previous word

Control + Right Arrow
:   Next word

Up Arrow
:   Prior line

Down Arrow
:   Next line

Right Arrow
:   Previous character

Left Arrow
:   Next character

F5
:   Page refresh

Control + F5
:   Hard page refresh. If you get lost, this is how you can start over.

NVDA + Control + Up Arrow
:   Rate of speech increase

NVDA + Control + Down Arrow
:   Rate of speech decrease

Try these keys with the sample passage below:

## Sample Passage

In the dreamtime, many ages ago, the cluster of stars which we now
know as the Pleiades, or the Seven Sisters, were seven beautiful ice
maidens. Their parents were a great rugged mountain whose dark head
was hidden in the clouds, and an ice-cold stream that flowed from the
snow-clad hills. The Seven Sisters wandered across the land, with
their long hair flying behind them like storm clouds before the
breeze. Their cheeks were flushed with the kiss of the sun, and in
their eyes was hidden the soft, gray light of the dawn. So entrancing
was their beauty, that all men loved them, but the maidens\'
affections were as cold as the stream which gave them birth, and they
never turned aside in their wanderings to gladden the hearts of men.



# Lesson 6.2: Navigation

Sighted users visually navigate through web content in a number of ways.
They skim for headings, lists, tables, etc. Most of these methods are
available to screen reader users if the site is correctly structured and
well organized. To navigate forward and backward through links and form
elements on the page, use **Tab** and **Shift + Tab**. Other shortcuts
are listed below.

## Quick Keys

The following Quick Keys will help you navigate common page elements.

-   H: Headings
-   D: Landmarks
-   1 - 6: Headings level 1-6
-   F: Forms
-   T: Tables
-   B: Buttons
    -   Tip: The Search button is often the first button on a page. You
        can often navigate to the search form by pressing B, to jump to
        the button and then **Shift + Tab** to navigate to the previous
        form element -- the search text box.
-   L: Lists
-   I: Items in a list

Shift + Quick Key will allow you to navigate through elements in reverse
order (works with most Quick Keys). Several other Quick Keys are
available in the [NVDA User
Guide](https://www.nvaccess.org/files/nvda/documentation/userGuide.html).

## Other navigation shortcuts

-   Insert + Control + F: Find text on the page
-   Insert + F7: Elements List - lists page links, headings, and landmarks
-   Ctrl + Home: Top of the page
-   Ctrl + End: Bottom of the Page
-   Alt + D: Browser address bar

To practice reading and navigation commands, try refreshing the page and
navigating to this section of the page. Try navigating by heading, list,
finding text, and using the elements list.



# Lesson 6.3: Table Navigation Commands

There are two main uses for tables on the web: for layout and to
organize data. In NVDA, to navigate to the next table, press the “T” key.
The following commands will allow a user to read a data table. It is
important to hold down the Control and the Alt key when pressing the
arrow keys.

| Command                     | Action              |
|-----------------------------|---------------------|
| Control + Alt + Left arrow  | Move left one cell  |
| Control + Alt + Right Arrow | Move Right one cell |
| Control + Alt + Up arrow    | Move up one cell    |
| Control + Alt + Down Arrow  | Move Down one cell  |

## Sample Tables

The following tables will provide you with some examples as to how to
navigate data tables on a web page. If a data table is designed
correctly, you should hear a summary of the information to be presented
in the table.

1. Table Example 1:
   | Day of the Week | Class    | Time  |
   |-----------------|----------|-------|
   | Monday          | History  | 9:00  |
   | Wednesday       | English  | 10:30 |
   | Friday          | Computer | 12:00 |

2. Table Example 2:
   | Spring | Summer | Autumn | Winter |
   |--------|--------|--------|--------|
   | Betty  | 9-5    | 10-6   | 8-4    |
   | Wilma  | 10-6   | 10-6   | 9-5    | 9-5  |
   | Fred   | 10-6   | 10-6   | 10-6   | 10-6 |



# Lesson 6.4: Navigating Forms

<aside>
Please note that forms may not work as expected in this eBook edition
of the lessons. To practice, go to [The Al Assist
website](http://www.alassist.us), log in, then go to
<https://moodle.alassist.us/mod/page/view.php?id=1151&forceview=1>.
</aside>

Forms on a web page can be difficult to navigate if they have not been
designed correctly. Additionally, it can be problematic when using a
screen reader as it is not easy to understand what information is being
requested in the form field.

When using a screen reader to complete an online form, the screen reader
enters forms mode when you press Enter within a form field. You can also
press **Insert + Space** to enter forms mode.

## Form Commands

| Result           | Keystroke               |
|------------------|-------------------------|
| Enter Forms Mode | Enter or Insert + Space |
| Button           | b                       |
| Combo Box        | c                       |
| Landmark         | d                       |
| Edit Box         | e                       |
| Form             | f                       |
| Image            | g                       |

### Quick Navigation

Screen reader users often encounter problems with JavaScript jump menus.
This is because the menu is set to "jump" to a link as soon as it

first item in the list. If this happens, press **Alt + Down Arrow** to
open a list, then the arrow keys to choose an item, then **Alt + Up
arrow** to close the list.

# Lesson 7.1: Browser History

## Viewing history

Browsers are a great way to get information from several places. You
already know about jumping back to the previous page with **Alt + Left
Arrow**, and forward with **Alt + Right Arrow**. Your browser keeps
track of all the pages that you visit, unless you are in private
browsing mode. This is called the browser *history*.

To access the browser history, on Firefox or Google Chrome, press
**Control + H**. Now, use **Tab** to find the tree view. In a tree view,
you can use the **up** and **down** arrow keys to navigate the list, and
**Right** and **Left** arrows to *expand* or *collapse* lists within the
main list. The tree view will have pages you've visited, some grouped
into dates and times, like "this morning," "Last night," "Last week,"
and "six months ago." Press *Right **arrow** on these closed items to
open them, and view the history items inside. To close the list, press
**Left Arrow**. To open a page from history, press **Enter** on it.

## Changing History

To see other actions possible with items in history, press the
**Applications** (or **Context**) key. In this menu, use the **Up** and
**Down** arrow keys to move through the items available. These items may
include: Open, Open in new tab, Copy, and Delete. To use one of these
items, press **Enter** on it.



# Lesson 7.2: Managing Bookmarks

Browser bookmarks are just like physical ones. They allow you to save a
favorite page you visit often, like your favorite social network,
important pages for work or school, the home page with all of your
courses, or your favorite informational site to a list, which you can
quickly access.

## Adding a bookmark

Visit a page you would like to visit often. Try this with [This page.
Trust me, you'll love this one](http://www.alassist.us). Open that link
in a new tab, by pressing the **Applications** or **Context menu** key,
Arrowing Down to "Open in New Tab," and pressing **Enter**. Now, you can
press **Control + Tab** to go between that page and this one.

To add this new page to bookmarks, press **Control + D** for "Add". A
dialog box will appear, allowing you to change its name, put it into a
folder, and other things before you confirm that you want to add it.
Press the "OK" button, or simply press **Enter** on the "Name" field.
Your Bookmark is now added.

## Managing Bookmarks

You may now want to simply look through the list of bookmarks you have,
to open them or otherwise manage them. To do this:

-   Press **Alt + F** to open the browser menu. If using Firefox,
    navigate using the **Right Arrow** to the Bookmarks" menu and press
    **Down Arrow**. If using Google Chrome, simply Down Arrow to the
    Bookmarks menu and press *Right Arrow to open it.
-   Arrow Down to the bookmark you want.
    -   To use the Bookmark, press **Enter**.
    -   To manage it, press the **Applications** key, then Down Arrow to
        the action you want to perform.
-   If you simply want to exit the Bookmarks menu, press **Escape** a
    few times to return to the page you were on before entering the
    menu.

## deleting Bookmarks

Sometimes, a site you thought might be interesting turns out to be
rather boring, or a bookmark you added in the last section turns out to
be a site that you visit every weekday. You don't necessarily *have* to
delete bookmarks, as they take up very little space, but it may be good
to clear away space to tidy up your bookmarks list of ones that you
don't use. Let's practice deleting that bookmark to the new site you
added in the "Adding Bookmark" section.

-   Open the Bookmarks Menu
    -   In Firefox, press **Alt + B**
    -   In Chrome, press **Alt + F, then B**
-   Press the **Up Arrow** until you find the bookmark you want to
    delete
-   Press the **Applications** key
-   Arrow to "delete" and press **Enter**

When you have practiced these sections until you are confident in how to
add, manage, and delete bookmarks, read through the appendix.

After the completion of all lessons, you will be given a performance
test. study well, but there is no need to be nervous, as this test can
be taken again if you fail the first time.

character keys to jump to certain fields in the document. Note that not
all of these commands are supported in every type of document.

The following keys by themselves jump to the next available element,
while adding the shift key causes them to jump to the previous element:

:   list

i
:   list item

t
:   table

k
:   link

n
:   nonLinked text

f
:   form field

u
:   unvisited link

v
:   visited link

e
:   edit field

b
:   button

x
:   checkbox

c
:   combo box

r
:   radio button

q
:   block quote

s
:   separator

m
:   frame

g
:   graphic

d
:   landmark

o
:   embedded object

1 to 6
:   headings at levels 1 to 6 respectively

To move to the beginning or end of containing elements such as lists and
tables:

### The Elements List

The elements list provides access to a list of either links, headings or
landmarks in the document. Radio buttons allow you to switch between
these three types of information. An edit field is also provided in the
dialog which allows you to filter the list to help you search for a
particular item on the page. Once you have chosen an item, you can use
the provided buttons in the dialog to move to or activate that item. For
faster, and easier navigation to a specific place on the page, the Find
dialog box is recommended.

| Name                      | Key     | Description                                                                                        |

encountered in browse mode, NVDA will report "embedded object",
"application" or "dialog", respectively. You can press enter on
these objects to interact with them. If it is accessible, you can then
tab around it and interact with it like any other application. A key
command is provided to return to the original page containing the
embedded object:

| Name                                    | Key                | Description                                                                               |
|-----------------------------------------|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Move to containing browse mode document | NVDA+control+space | Moves the focus out of the current embedded object and into the document that contains it |



## Appendix 3: Firefox Commands

### Notes

These keyboard commands are taken from the Firefox help pages. Because
these were written for a sighted audience, some of them will not work
with a screen reader. Particularly, the “current page” section has
“home” and “end” commands which will not go to the top and bottom of
the page. The commands assumes the use of no assistive technology,
however some of the commands can be used with a screen reader, like
Print and Save. When you use lists of keyboard shortcuts, it is
important to know how your screen reader treats pages on the Internet,
and how keyboard commands will interact with this usage.
