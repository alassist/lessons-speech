## Lesson 3.4

No matter what type of Internet service you have, it's possible to
connect wirelessly (known as Wi-Fi), as long as you have the right
equipment. Many computers have built-in wireless cards, but if you have
a computer that does not, you can purchase them separately. You'll also
need some type of wireless access point (for example, a wireless router)
that will connect to your modem.

Whenever you're using any kind of wireless Internet, you'll need to
take extra security measures to protect your private data. Wireless
security standards such as Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) encrypt the data
before it's sent. When you setup your Wi-Fi, you'll want to set up
your wireless security. You will create a username and password that you
can use to securely connect to the Internet.

Some cities provide free, citywide Wi-Fi, which means you may not need
to purchase Internet access or a wireless access point. A list of cities
