# Lesson 4: Setting settings

ChromeVox has many settings which can be adjusted. Some are in the
ChromeVox settings page, while others can be set by using keyboard
commands from anywhere. In this lesson, you’ll learn about how to
change ChromeVox voice settings, use the ChromeVox options page, and
set punctuation and typing echo.

## Change ChromeVox voice settings

You can change aspects of ChromeVox’s voice without needing to open
ChromeVox options. You can raise or lower the speech pitch and
speaking rate.

To speed up ChromeVox’s speech, press **Search + Left Bracket ([)**.
To slow down the speech rate, press **Search + Shift + Left Bracket
([)**. To raise Chromevox’s speech pitch, press **Search + Right
Bracket (])**. To lower the speech pitch, press **Search + Shift +
Right Bracket (])**.

## Use the ChromeVox options page

ChromeVox contains an options page, where you can set things like the
voice ChromeVox uses, how much it speaks, and configure braille
displays for use with ChromeVox. To open the settings page, press
**Search + O, O**. The options you’ll find will be listed below,
along with what they do. Use the Tab key to navigate among them, and
use **Search + Space** to configure them. If a checkbox is checked,
then the item is turned on, or enabled. If it is not checked, then the
item is turned off, or disabled. Use arrow keys to choose an item in a
popup list.

<dl>
<dt>Enable verbose descriptions</dt>
<dd>This checkbox tells ChromeVox to either speak as much information
as possible, when checked, or to play sounds instead of speaking
repetitive item descriptions.</dd>
<dt>Automatically read page after it finishes loading</dt>
<dd>This checkbox tells ChromeVox to either read a new page after it
finishes loading or not.</dd>
<dt>Speak text under the mouse</dt>

under the mouse pointer if you move the mouse. This will only be useful for someone with low vision.</dd>
<dt>When reading capitals:</dt>
<dd>This pop up allows you to choose if you want ChromeVox to say
"cap" or raise the speech pitch when reading capital letters. Use the
arrow keys to choose an option.</dd>

notifications that appear when you download a file or not.</dd>
<dt>When playing audio:</dt>
<dd>This popup allows you to choose if you want ChromeVox to pause
audio when speaking, play at normal volume even when ChromeVox is
speaking, or play at lower volume when ChromeVox is speaking, when
other audio besides ChromeVox is playing.</dd>
<dt>Select current voice:</dt>
<dd>This popup allows you to choose the voice ChromeVox speaks
with.</dd>

<dt>Switch to six-dot/eight-dot braille</dt>
<dd>This button allows you to switch the braille presentation from six
dot to eight dot cells, depending on its current setting.</dd>
<dt>Enable word wrap</dt>
<dd>This check box allows you to turn off or on braille word wrap.
This allows ChromeVox to not split a longer word onto multiple lines,
if enabled.</dd>
<dt>Select a Bluetooth braille display</dt>
<dd>This popup allows you to select a braille display connected over
Bluetooth, rather than plugged in through USB.</dd>

caption panel.</dd>
<dt>Enable developer options</dt>

## Setting punctuation and typing echo

ChromeVox has a few other settings that can be changed outside of the
Options page. These are the typing echo and punctuation settings.
These can be set anywhere, so you can use different settings at
different times, easily.

There may be times when you want to hear more or less punctuation than
ChromeVox normally speaks. You may be writing in Google Docs, and so
want to proofread your work. You may also be reading a book for
pleasure, so don’t want to hear any punctuation at all. You can change
punctuation settings by pressing **Search + A, P**. Your options
are "none," speaking no punctuation, "Some," speaking some less-used
punctuation, and "All," speaking all punctuation.

When you first get your Chromebook, ChromeVox will speak every key you
type. This may be good in the beginning, when learning the new
keyboard and system, but when you get used to it, the repeating, or
echoing, of typed keys can be distracting. You can change how that
works by pressing **Search + A, T**. Your options are
"characters," where ChromeVox speaks all of the letters, numbers, and
symbols that you type, "Words," where ChromeVox speaks only when
you’ve finished typing a word, "Characters and words," where ChromeVox
speaks both, and "Nothing," where ChromeVox speaks neither.
