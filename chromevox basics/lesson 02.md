# Lesson 2: Basic navigation

Chromebooks can be navigated using the keyboard. You’ve already seen
this in the first lesson, when starting ChromeVox and using the
keyboard help mode. The Chromebook, however, also has its own set of
useful commands, not a part of ChromeVox specifically, that can be
used to navigate the system. ChromeVox works alongside these commands,
to speak the result of the navigation.

In this lesson, you’ll learn about keyboard focus, navigating with the
Tab key, opening and closing windows and tabs, and accessing the
"Shelf" and "status tray." These features of the Chromebook may seem
trivial now, but in conjunction with faster navigation techniques
presented in the next lesson, you’ll find that each command will be
useful in different situations.

## Keyboard focus

Keyboard focus is the way in which the Chromebook keeps up with where
you are on the screen when using keyboard commands. It is similar to a
mouse cursor, except it is not shown on the screen unless you are
editing text. Your screen reader *can* be set to read what is under
the mouse, but since we cannot have exact control of the mouse, it is
pretty useless for us. People with usable vision can use this feature,
along with magnification, to help them use the Chromebook more easily.
Since some Chromebooks do not have touch screens, this course focuses
mainly on the keyboard.

With the keyboard, you are able to move around the screen. The screen
reader will read each item the keyboard focus arrives on as you move
it. The screen reader will not automatically read your screen,
however. You must use keyboard commands in order to tell the computer
to move to the next item, or to the previous item, or any number of
other commands. Later in this course, you will learn how to tell the
screen reader to read an entire page or document, but you still must
perform a keyboard command to do so.

## Navigating with the Tab key

When you press the Tab key, the keyboard focus moves to the next item
on the screen, with some exceptions. You can use the Tab key to move
around pages on the web, web apps, and Android apps. If you are within
the status tray, or the Launcher, Tab will move through only items on
that area. Tab will also not move from a web page or app to the status
area.

To move backward, the opposite of Tab, use Shift + Tab. This command
also will not move from a web page or app to the Status tray or
Launcher.

## Using windows and tabs

The Chromebook allows you to not only open one page or app at a time.
You can have many different tabs or windows open at a time. This
allows you, for example, to write a document in one window, with
research for that document in a tab of that window, while keeping up
with email in another window. This ability to "multitask" makes using
a computer more efficient and powerful.

The use of tabs and windows is up to the user. You could have
everything in a separate window, if that is easier for you. You could
have everything in tabs to keep down the use of many windows. Or, you
can group things by activity, having separate windows for separate
parts of work or life. Any way you choose, the Chromebook is flexible.

Use the following keyboard commands to work with windows and tabs:

<dl>
<dt>Control + N</dt>
<dd>Open new window</dd>
<dt>Control + T</dt>
<dd>Open new tab</dd>
<dt>Control + W</dt>
<dd>Close the current tab or window</dd>
<dt>Alt + tab</dt>
<dd>Switch between windows</dd>
<dt>Control + tab</dt>
<dd>Switch between tabs</dd>
<dt>Control + Shift + T</dt>
<dd>Open the most recently closed tab</dd>
<dt>Control + Shift + N</dt>
<dd>Open a new window in Incognito mode</dd>
<dt>Control + shift + W</dt>
<dd>Close the current window</dd>
<dt>Control + 1, through Control + 8</dt>
<dd>Go to tabs 1 through 8 in the current window</dd>
<dt>Control + 9</dt>
<dd>Go to the last tab in a window</dd>
</dl>

<aside>
<p><b>Note</b>: To easily switch to a window that isn't the two most currently used, hold down the Alt key and press Tab more than once before releasing the Alt key.
</p>
</aside>

When you open a new tab or window, you are immediately placed into the
address edit field. This area is where you tell your Chromebook where
you want to go. You can type in an address to visit, like
"<https://www.alassist.us>", or search the web, like "assistive
technology". When you’ve finished typing, press **Enter**, and either
the page you entered the address to, or search results, will appear.
Navigation of these pages will be covered in the next lesson.

To close a tab or window, use **Control + W**. ChromeVox will play a
sound, and you’ll be placed on the tab or window that you were in
before the one you closed.

### Exercise: Opening and closing a window

Please perform the following steps to practice opening and close a window:

1. Open a new window, with **Control + N**.
2. Type "al.com" without the quotes.
3. Press **Control + N** again to create another window.
4. Type "Alabama news" without the quotes, and press **Enter**.
5. press **Control + W** to close that window.
6. Press **Control + W** again to close the first new window.

Now, you should have the idea of how windows work. Tabs work the same
way, but using the keyboard commands associated with tabs creation.

## Using the Shelf

The Shelf is where you can run programs or apps. If you want to
quickly open Gmail, Google Docs, or Youtube, the shelf has those items
and more for quick access. The Shelf also gives access to the
Launcher, which has even more programs, like a file manager and music
player, that you can open. If you've used Windows before, the Shelf is
like the desktop, and the Launcher is like the Start menu.

To access the Shelf, press **Alt + Shift + L**. To navigate the items
on the Shelf, use the Arrow keys. ChromeVox will tell you which item
you have navigated to. To open an item, press Enter. If you open the
Launcher, you can navigate its items with the arrow keys, and open one
with Enter as well.

### Exercise: using the shelf

Please perform the following steps to practice using the shelf:

1. Move to the shelf with **Alt + Shift + L**.
2. Arrow to "Gmail," and press **Enter**.
3. Close the Gmail tab with **Control + W**.
4. Move back to the shift, and find the "Launcher" item.
5. Open the Launcher with **Enter**.
6. Find the "Files" app, and press **Enter** to open it.
7. Close the files app with **Control + W**.


Now you should be able to use the shift to open frequently used apps,
and the launcher to navigate and open any app you have on your Chromebook.

## Accessing the status tray

The "Status Tray" is an area of the Chromebook screen that displays
status information, and allows you to manage certain hardware
functions like wireless networking, sound volume, and screen
brightness, without needing to enter Chrome's settings.

To access this information, press **Alt + Shift + S**. You will hear
information right away, like the current time, battery power, and
Internet signal. You can Tab around to find controls for turning on
and off networking functions, adjust the brightness of your screen and
volume of your speakers or headphones, and to shut down the
Chromebook, restart it, or sign out of the current user. If you don’t
want to use any of the controls on the status tray, just press
**Escape**.

### Exercise: using the Status tray

Please perform the following steps to practice using the status tray:

1. Press **Alt + Shift + S** to move to the status tray.
2. Note how much battery power you have left.
3. Tab to "Airplane mode" and make sure it is turned off.
4. Find the "shut down" button.

Now, you know how to use the status tray to get status information on
the time, battery level, and other information, check network
functions, and you know where to go to shut down the computer.
