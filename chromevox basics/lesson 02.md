## Basic navigation

You can navigate the Chromebook using the keyboard. You’ve already seen this in using the keyboard help mode in the first lesson. Although not part of ChromeVox, the Chromebook has its own set of commands that can you can use to navigate the system. ChromeVox works alongside these commands, to speak the result of the navigation.

In this lesson, you’ll learn about keyboard focus, navigating with the Tab key, opening, and closing windows and tabs, and accessing the "Shelf" and "status tray." These features of the Chromebook may seem trivial now, but in conjunction with faster navigation techniques presented in the next lesson, you’ll find that each command will be useful in different situations.

## Keyboard focus

Keyboard focus is the way in which the Chromebook keeps up with where you are on the screen when using keyboard commands. It is like a mouse cursor, except it is not shown on the screen unless you are editing text. Your screen reader *can* be set to read what is under the mouse, but it is not very helpful for people with no vision. People with usable vision can use this feature, possibly with magnification. Since some Chromebooks do not have touch screens, ours focuses on the keyboard.

With the keyboard, you are able to move around the screen. The screen reader will read each item the keyboard focus arrives on as you move it. The screen reader will not automatically read your screen, however. You must use keyboard commands to tell the computer to move to the next item, or to the previous item, or any number of other commands. Later in this course, you will learn how to tell the screen reader to read an entire page or document, but you still must perform a keyboard command to do so.

## Navigating with the Tab key

When you press the **Tab** key, the keyboard focus moves to the next form field, link, or control on the screen, with some exceptions. You cannot move to text with the tab key, and cannot read line by line with the tab key, only from one control to the next. It is useful for moving around a web program, but not useful for reading an article. You can also use Tab to move around Android apps. If you are within the status tray or the Shelf, Tab will move through only items in that area. Tab will also not move from a web page or app to the status area.

To move backward, the opposite of Tab, use **Shift + Tab**. This command also will not move from a web page or app to the Status tray or Launcher.

## Using windows and tabs

The Chromebook allows you to not only open one page or app at a time. You can have many different tabs or windows open. Windows are entire screens of information, whereas tabs are like smaller windows within a window. This allows you, for example, to write a document in one window, with research for that document in another tab of that window, while keeping up with email in another window. Note that a Tab, in the sense of multitasking, is not the same as using the tab key to "tab" through items. This ability to "multitask" makes using a computer more efficient and powerful.

The use of tabs and windows is up to the user. You could have everything in a separate window if that is easier for you. You could have everything in tabs to keep down the use of many windows. Or, you can group things by activity, having separate windows for separate parts of work or home life. Any way you choose, the Chromebook is flexible.

Use the following keyboard commands to work with windows and tabs:

<dl>
<dt>Control + N</dt>
<dd>Open new window</dd>
<dt>Control + T</dt>
<dd>Open new tab</dd>
<dt>Control + W</dt>
<dd>Close the current tab or window</dd>
<dt>Alt + tab</dt>
<dd>Switch between windows</dd>
<dt>Control + tab</dt>
<dd>Switch between tabs</dd>
<dt>Control + Shift + T</dt>
<dd>Open the most recently closed tab</dd>
<dt>Control + Shift + N</dt>
<dd>Open a new window in Incognito mode</dd>
<dt>Control + shift + W</dt>
<dd>Close the current window</dd>
<dt>Control + 1, through Control + 8</dt>
<dd>Go to tabs 1 through 8 in the current window</dd>
<dt>Control + 9</dt>
<dd>Go to the last tab in a window</dd>
</dl>

<aside>
<p><b>Note</b>: To easily switch to a window that isn't the two most currently used, hold down the Alt key and press Tab more than once before releasing the Alt key.

When you open a new tab or window, you are immediately placed into the address, or location, edit field. This area is for telling your Chromebook where you want to go. You can type in an address to visit, like "https://www.alassist.us", or search the web, like "assistive technology". You need not type quote marks into the location bar for searching the web, and should not use quotes when typing a web address. When you’ve finished typing, press **Enter**, and either the page you entered the address to, or search results will appear. You will learn how to navigate these pages in the next lesson.

To close a tab or window, use **Control + W**. ChromeVox will play a sound and place you on the tab or window that you were in before the one you closed. If you are already on a page, and you want to go to a new site, or start a new search, without leaving the current tab or window, press **Control + L**, for "location".

### Exercise: Opening and closing a window

Please perform the following steps to practice opening and closing a window:

1. Open a new window, with **Control + N**.
2. Type "al.com" without the quotes, and press **Enter**.
3. Press **Control + N** again to create another window.
4. Type "Alabama news" without the quotes, and press **Enter**.
5. press **Control + W** to close that window.
6. Press **Control + W** again to close the first new window.

Now, you should have the idea of how windows work. Tabs work the same way but using the keyboard commands associated with tab creation.

## Using the Shelf

The shelf is where you can run programs or apps. If you want to quickly open Gmail, Google Docs, or Youtube, the shelf has those items and more for quick access. The shelf also gives access to the launcher, which has even more programs, like a file manager and music player, that you can open. If you've used Windows before, the Shelf is like the desktop, and the Launcher is like the Start menu.

To access the Shelf, press **Alt + Shift + L**. To navigate the items on the Shelf, use the Arrow keys. ChromeVox will tell you which item you have navigated to. To open an item, press **Enter**. If you open the Launcher, you can navigate its items with the arrow keys, and open one with **Enter** as well.

### Exercise: using the Shelf

Please perform the following steps to practice using the shelf:

1. Move to the shelf with **Alt + Shift + L**.
2. Arrow to "Gmail," and press **Enter**.
3. Close the Gmail tab with **Control + W**.
4. Move back to the Shelf, and find the "Launcher" item.
5. Open the Launcher with **Enter**.
6. Find the "Files" app, and press **Enter** to open it.
7. Close the files app with **Control + W**.
Now you should be able to use the Shelf to open frequently used apps, and the launcher to navigate and open any app you have on your Chromebook.

## Accessing the status tray

The "Status Tray" is an area of the Chromebook screen that displays status information, and allows you to manage certain hardware functions like wireless networking, sound volume, and screen brightness, without needing to enter Chrome's settings.

To access this information, press **Alt + Shift + S**. You will hear information right away, like the current time, battery power, and Internet signal. You can Tab around to find controls for turning on and off networking functions, adjust the brightness of your screen and volume of your speakers or headphones, and to shut down the Chromebook, restart it, or sign out of the current user. If you don’t want to use any of the controls on the status tray, press **Escape**.

### Exercise: using the Status tray

Please perform the following steps to practice using the status tray:

1. Press **Alt + Shift + S** to move to the status tray.
2. Note how much battery power you have left.
3. Tab to "Airplane mode" and make sure to turn it off.
4. Find the "shut down" button.
5. Press **Escape** to exit the Status Tray. Do not press the shut down button.

Now, you know how to use the status tray to get status information on the time, battery level, and other information, check network functions, and you know where to go to shut down the computer.
