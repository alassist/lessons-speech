# Lesson 5: Miscellaneous topics

In Lesson 3, you learned how to move around a page by using keyboard commands, like Search + H for headings. In Lesson 2, you learned about using tabs and windows. In this lesson, you'll finish this course with even more information on navigating both of the afore mentioned parts of the Chromebook, how to use the Context menu, finding out what’s new in ChromeVox, and getting help with ChromeVox and your Chromebook.

## The ChromeVox menu

The ChromeVox menu is a menu which you can use to explore and move to many different parts of the Chromebook interface, even other tabs and windows that you have open. You can also use this as an alternative to using keyboard commands to move around a page, if you find that easier. the ChromeVox menu displays all of the keyboard commands you can use. There are a few items in these menus that are not in this guide, so that you can learn even more commands through using this menu.

To open the ChromeVox menu, press **Search + . (period**. You’ll be placed in the "jump menu," where you can "jump" to an item type. use the Up and Down arrows to navigate this menu, or the Left and Right arrows to navigate to other menus, like the Speech or Tabs menu. Press **Enter** on a menu item to activate it, or **Escape** to exit this menu.

### The Jump menu

Use this menu to find all keyboard commands related to jumping to the next or previous item on the page. You can use this as you are learning ChromeVox's keyboard commands. You can press **Enter** to activate the one you want, or **Escape** to cancel. For example, if you want to move to the next heading, find the "next heading" command, and press **Enter** to jump to it.

### Speech menu

This menu allows you to choose a speech command to activate, or just learn what the keyboard commands are. You can activate one with the **Enter** key, or go back to what you were doing before with the **Escape** key. For example, if you want ChromeVox to speak a little faster, find the "increase speech rate" command, and press **Enter**.

### Tabs menu

This menu allows you to move to any tab you have open on the Chromebook. Find a tab you want to move to, and press **Enter** to be taken to that tab. If you don’t want to choose a different tab, just press **Escape** to be taken back to the page you’re on.

### ChromeVox

This menu contains ChromeVox utilities, like the ChromeVox tutorial, keyboard help mode, and an option to open the ChromeVox options page. Be aware that there is also a command to turn off ChromeVox in this menu. To activate a command, for example to open the ChromeVox options page, find the command you want, and press **Enter**. To exit the menu without activating a command, press **Escape**.

### Actions

This menu lists actions you can take on the item currently in focus, like "activate", or "start selection". You can activate one of these with **Enter**, or exit the menu with **Escape**.

### Items list

The following are menus in the ChromeVox menu, listing types of items. You can use this to find specific items, like a specific heading on a page, for example.

<dl>
<dt>Headings</dt>
<dd>A list of headings on the page</dd>
<dt>Landmarks</dt>
<dd>A list of landmarks, overall sections of a page</dd>
<dt>Links</dt>
<dd>A list of all links on a page</dd>
<dt>Forms</dt>
<dd>A list of forms: text entry fields, buttons, and check boxes, on
the page</dd>
<dt>Tables</dt>
<dd>A list of tables on the page</dd>
</dl>

## The Context menu

In some cases, there may be actions that you can perform on items: correcting a misspelled word, selecting an option in an app, and so on, that won’t work with the Enter key. These secondary actions are in the "context" menu, named because the items in this menu are different depending on the *context* of what you are doing.

To open this menu, press **Search + M**. You’ll be given a list of actions you can take. To navigate the menu, use the Up and Down arrow keys, and **Enter** to choose an item. To exit the menu, use the **Escape** key.

## Finding what’s new with ChromeVox

Your Chromebook gets updated often, and so does ChromeVox. Almost monthly, a new version of the ChromeOS operating system, the software that all of your apps and web activity runs on top of, is updated whenever possible. Along with general fixes, ChromeVox is also updated with new features and bug fixes.

To check what’s new in ChromeVox, press **Search + O, N**. This will open a page detailing the changes and fixes to ChromeVox. You can navigate this page as you would any other page on the Internet. To exit this page, use **Control + W** to close the tab or window.

## Getting more help

If you need further help with ChromeVox or your Chromebook, there are many resources that can be of use. ChromeVox has a discussion email group which you can join, you can send feedback directly to ChromeVox’s developers, or search Google for general questions regarding your Chromebook.

The ChromeVox discussion group is an email group for discussion about the usage of ChromeVox, and other Chromebook topics. To read about the discussion group and join it, see the [ChromeVox Discuss group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/chromevox-discuss).

To send feedback directly to the ChromeVox developers, press **Search + A, I**. You can give them feedback regarding bugs you’ve found, features you’d like to be added, or changes you’d like to see in ChromeVox or Chromebook accessibility.

If you have general questions about the Chromebook, like which apps to use, manuals for your specific Chromebook, or more keyboard commands for the Chromebook, including ChromeVox commands, you can use Google to search for that information.

To perform a Google search, open a new window with **Control + N**, type what you’re looking for, and press **Enter**. When the page loads, press **Search + H** until after you hear "Search Results." The heading after the Search results heading is where the search results begin. Any heading that is also a link is a search result that you can press **Enter** on to navigate to that page.
