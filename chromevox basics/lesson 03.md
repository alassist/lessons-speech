# Lesson 3: Moving around pages

Depending on your needs, ChromeVox may primarily be used on websites
and web apps, or used with Android apps. In this lesson, you’ll learn
how to move around a page. This includes reading the whole page one
item at a time, reading by characters, words, and lines, moving to
different types of items with a keyboard command, getting lists of
items, and searching for items.

## Reading item by item

Using ChromeVox, you can read a page one item at a time. This is
useful if you are just getting started with the screen reader, or if
you are unfamiliar with the page you want to read.

Items on a web page are sometimes called elements. They are things
like paragraphs of text, a form that you can fill out, a link to take
you to another location, or a button which can be pressed. To move to
the next item, press **Search + Right Arrow**. To move to the previous
item, press **Search + Left Arrow**.

You can also move by character. A character is a letter, number,
symbol, space, or new line. This is useful for learning how to spell
something, like a name, that you find on a page. To move to the next character, press
**Search + Shift + Right arrow**. To move to the previous character,
use **Search + Shift + Left arrow**.

You can navigate by word, as well. This is useful to quickly navigate
to the beginning of a place to navigate by character. To navigate
forward by word, press **Search + Shift + Control + Right Arrow**. To
move backward by word, use **Search + Control + Shift + Left Arrow**.

You can also navigate one line at a time. This is different than
navigating by item. A paragraph is one entire item, but when
navigating by line, you can read the individual lines in that
paragraph. To navigate to the next line, use **Search + Down Arrow**.
To navigate to the previous line, use **Search + Up Arrow**.

You can also move to the top and bottom of the page. This is useful if
you get lost and want to start reading from the beginning. To move to
the top of the page, press **Search + Control + Left Arrow**. To move
to the bottom, use **Search + Control + Right Arrow**.

If you want to simply read the entire page, from the current position,
you can press **Search + R**. This is good for reading long articles
or pages of text, where you wouldn’t want to continue pressing
Search + Right Arrow.

### Exercise: Move through pages

Please perform the following steps to practice moving throughout a
page:

1. Open a new window.
2. Type "al.com" without the quotes, and press **Enter**.
3. move around the page, by object, line, character, and word.

Now, you’ve experienced basic navigation around a page. Next, you’ll
focus on moving around more quickly.

## Moving to specific item types

Using ChromeVox, you can move to different types of items with a
keyboard command. You can either move forward or backward through the
page by an item. Below is a list of the keyboard commands, and what
they do. Since each keyboard command uses the Search key, that part of
the keyboard command will be left out. You can use the Shift key to
move backward by that type of item. So, if the key is "B", you use
Search + B to move forward by that item type, and Shift + Search + B
to move backward by that item type.

<dt>L</dt>
<dd>Link</dd>
<dt>T</dt>
<dd>Table</dd>
<dt>V</dt>
<dd>Visited Link</dd>
</dl>

## Getting lists of items

There may be times when you wish to get a list of all items of a
certain type on a page. You may wish to get a list of headings, to
move to a particular one without needing to press Search + H a few
times, or you may be looking for a particular link. You can do that
with the following commands:

<dl>
<dt>Search + Control + H</dt>
<dd>Show a list of headings</dd>
<dt>Search + Control + ; (Semi-colon)</dt>
<dd>Show a list of Landmarks</dd>
<dt>Search + Control + L</dt>
<dd>Show a list of links</dd>
<dt>Search + Control + F</dt>
<dd>Show a list of form fields</dd>
<dt>Search + Control + T</dt>
<dd>Show a list of tables</dd>
</dl>

### Exercise: Using item lists

Please perform the following steps to practice using item lists:

1. Open a new window, and go to al.com.
2. open a list of headings, and arrow down through the list.
3. Press **Escape** to close the list.
4. Open a list of links, and arrow down the list.
5. Press **Enter** on any link.
6. Press **Control + W** to close the window.

Now, you’ve experienced using lists of items.

## Searching for an item

Rather than finding a list of items, you may want to move directly to
an item you’re looking for. This is useful if you know the name of
what you’re looking for, so you don’t need to move using more manual
means. This can make browsing the web very quick.

To search for an item, press **Search + / (slash**. Type what you want
to find, and press **Enter**. ChromeVox will place focus on that item.

### Exercise: Searching for an item

Please perform the following steps to practice searching for an item:

1. Open a new window, and go to apple.com.
2. Press **Search + / (slash)**, and search for "iPhone" without the
   quotes.
3. Press **Enter**, and ChromeVox will find the first occurrence of
   the word "iPhone."

Now, you can search for a word on pages that you go to. This makes
browsing the web much quicker if you know what you’re looking for.
