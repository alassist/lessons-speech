# Lesson 1: Introduction

This course will teach you how to use ChromeVox, the screen reader on the Chromebook. ChromeVox is a free screen reader that comes with yourChromebook, so you don’t have to download anything extra. It also gets frequent updates alongside your Chromebook, so you need not worry about a license expiring, or incompatibilities between the Chromebook and ChromeVox versions. ChromeVox can be used on other devices, but since there can be complications during usage of ChromeVox on other types of computers besides Chromebooks, the use of ChromeVox on other operating systems won’t be discussed in this course.

This course attempts to be as up-to-date as possible. However, as new versions are released, some things may work better, or differently, than described in this course. If you find problems or have suggestions, please let your instructor know.

In this lesson, you will learn about what ChromeVox is, and what it works with. You will then learn about the Chromebook keyboard, and how it differs from other keyboards used on Windows and Mac computers. Next, you’ll learn how keyboard commands are represented in this course, then how to activate ChromeVox. Finally, you’ll learn how to find out what the keys on your Chromebook do, using ““keyboard help.””

## What is ChromeVox?

ChromeVox is the screen reader built into your Chromebook. It is made by Google and updated whenever your Chromebook is updated. ChromeVox can read textual content. This means that it can read paragraphs, headings, links, lists, described images, and other page structures. It cannot, however, read pictures that have not been described, videos, and other such graphical data that does not have textual alternatives.

Screen readers are not smart, even in the “AI age,” and ChromeVox is no exception. However, the Internet becomes more accessible one step at a time, and if a website or program is not accessible, you may contact the site administrator or the program developer to ask that it be made accessible.

Chromebooks run the ChromeOS system, which is like the Chrome web browser. This means that you will mostly use websites, like <https://www.alassist.us>, and web applications, like Gmail, Google Docs, or Google Classroom. Some Chromebooks can run Android apps, which are mobile programs. These may or may not be accessible, depending on the app. If the Android app is accessible, ChromeVox will work with that app.

## The Chromebook keyboard

The Chromebook keyboard is a little different from a regular laptop keyboard. There is no number pad, so you must use the number row near the top of the keyboard to enter numeric data. The function keys are different, too. From the left-most top key, that row is:

* Escape
* Back
* Forward
* Refresh
* Toggle Fullscreen
* Window Overview
* brightness Down
* Brightness Up
* Volume Mute
* Volume Down
* Volume Up
* Power

The modifier keys are different, too. Instead of the Capslock key, there is the “Search” key. There is no Windows key, only Alt and Control. So, on the bottom of the keyboard, the keys are: 

* Control
* Alt
* Space
* Alt
* Control
* Arrow keys

## Keyboard commands

Keyboard commands are how you tell the computer what to do, where to go, and what items on the screen to speak. Keyboard commands are done by pressing one or more keys at the same time. If more than one key is to be pressed, one usually holds down a “modifier” key, like Control, Alt, or Search, and presses a regular key, like Tab, T, or Right Arrow.

To show these keyboard commands, this course uses the standard notation used by other courses. Most keyboard commands are in bold, while explanatory ones are not, except for the ones in this section. Keys are written out, with a plus symbol (+), between them. The Modifier key is given first, then the key that it modifies. For example, **Search + R** means to hold down the Search key, and while still holding the Search key down, press the R key, then release both keys. If the keyboard command contains a punctuation mark, like a period, comma, or bracket, the symbol is spelled out in parentheses. For example, if you need to press Control + period, that would be written as **Control + . (period)**.

Some keyboard commands use multiple modified keys. This means that you press two or more keys while holding down the Modifier key. For these keyboard commands, the second, third, ETC. Modified keys are shown in a list format. For example, **Search + A, P** means to hold down the Search key, press A, release A, then while still holding Search, press P.

## Starting ChromeVox

To start ChromeVox, first, turn on the Chromebook, wait about a minute, and press **Control + Alt + Z**. If your Chromebook is a tablet and doesn’t have a keyboard attached, hold down the **Volume Up** and **Volume Down** keys together for five seconds. The first time you start ChromeVox, a tutorial will appear, to guide you through the basic usage of the screen reader. It is recommended to complete this
tutorial.

### The ChromeVox Tutorial

If the ChromeVox tutorial doesn't start when ChromeVox starts, hold down the Search key, and press O, then, while still holding Search, press T. This is the kind of keyboard command that is common with ChromeVox. You hold down the Search key, called the ChromeVox key, press a key, then another key while still holding Search. Some of these are easy to remember, like **Search + O, T** meaning “Open tutorial,” and others are not so easy.

The first lesson in the ChromeVox tutorial is about moving around a page. To complete this lesson, use the following keyboard commands:

<dl>
<dt>Search + Right Arrow</dt>
<dd>Move Right one object.</dd>
<dt>Search + Left Arrow</dt>
<dd>Move left one object.</dd>
<dt>Search + Space</dt>
<dd>Activate, or click, the current item.</dd>
</dl>

If you move to the end of a page, and move right one more time, you will hear a sound, and be placed onto the first item on the page. Inversely, if you move to the start of a page, then move left one more time, you will be placed at the end of the page. Continue the tutorial, and come back to this lesson when done.

## Keyboard Help

If you move to the end of a page and move right one more time, you will hear a sound, and be placed onto the first item on the page. Inversely, if you move to the start of a page, then move left one more time, you will be placed at the end of the page. Continue the tutorial, and come back to this lesson when done.

## Keyboard Help

ChromeVox includes a command for getting help with what the keys on your keyboard, buttons on a braille display, or touches on a touch screen, do. This “keyboard help” mode allows you to press any key without that keypress affecting anything, so you don’t have to worry about muting the volume, or opening anything unexpected.

To start Keyboard help, press **Search + O, K**. A new window will open, and ChromeVox will tell you how to use the keyboard help mode. Press some keys, and when done, use **Control + W** to close the window.

### Exercise: What time is it?

Please perform the following steps to practice keyboard help mode:

1. Open keyboard help mode with **Search + O, K**.
2. Press **Search + A, D**. You’ll hear the command described as the command to check the time and date.
3. Press **Control + W** to close keyboard help mode.
4. Press the command **Search + A, D**. You’ll hear the time and date.

Now, you know not only how to use the keyboard help mode, but also how to check the time and date using your Chromebook. Continue to the next lesson to learn about navigating the basic parts of your Chromebook.
